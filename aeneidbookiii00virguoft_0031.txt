INTRODUCTION. xxv

Trojan, reached the northernmost part of the Adriatic
(Aen. i. 242). The course of Aeneas has been traced by
cities which seemed to bear his name. or in which the
worship os his mother Venus was established, as for example
Mount Eryx, in Sicily. &Vhen the Romans were struggling
for existence against the Greeks, they embraced that form
ofthe legend which made them descendants ofthe old enemies
of the Greeks. Pyrrhus proclaimed himself as Aeacides¹.
a descendant of Achilles; so we find in Fabius Pictor that
the Romans take up the struggle as the true ofsspring os the
Trojans. After the second Punic war the image of the Great
Mother was brought from Asia to Rome, and favours were
granted to the land where Ilium had stood. But aster the
subjugation of Greece, when Greek culture became the main
element of Roman education, a strange alteration was intro·
duced. The Trojans came to be regarded as an Hellenic
race, sprung from Arcadia, like Evander in the Acnefd, while
the Greeks who sacked Troy were ‘ Achaeans.’ And so Virgil
gives Greek names to his Trojans, while the true Italian
names are assigned to the adherents of Turnus.

F urther‚ we find Latin tradition interwoven with the Greek
story. Thus the swine (Tr-0511, see Aen. iii. 389) with the
thirty young ones was the symbol of the Latin League, and
squares of bread were used as plates in an old Italian rite
(lb. 257). The Amneni, in its unfinished state, does not very
successfully harmonize the different versions os the story:—
for example, Book iii.‚ if taken by itself, would lead us to
suppose that the wanderings of Aeneas occupied a much
shorter period than the seven years stated in Book i.

Virgil too, in obedience to his Roman instinct, has intro-
duced two very important episodes, which are not very
accordant with the traditions he has elsewhere adopted.
The coming of Aeneas to Carthage‚ with the consequent love
and tragic fate of Did02‚ supplies an ancient ground sor the

¹ Ennius tells us that on consulting the Delphie omele he received
the ambiguous reply: ‘ Aio te, Aeacida, Romanos vincere posse!

the love os Aeneas.
