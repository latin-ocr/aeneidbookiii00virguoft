p. 9. Apollo h'elvcdere. The statue os Apollo after slaying the

the ravages of time.’ It was found in 1503 at Antium, the birth-
place of Nero, who may have brought it there srom Greeee. The
sculptor is unknown. The name is derived from the Belvedere,
⁴ prospect hall,' in the Vatican, where the statue is placed. Byron's
lines in Cln'lcle Harold, 1V. clxi, are worth quoting :—

‘ Or view the Lord of the unerring bow,
The gotl of life, and poesy, and light-
The sun in human limbs arrayed, and brow
All radiant from his triumph in the fight;
The shaft hath just been §hot—the arrow bright
With an immortal’s vengeancc; in his eye
And nostril beautiful (lisdain, and might,
And ruajesty, ssash their full lightnings by,
Developing in that one glauce the deity.'
