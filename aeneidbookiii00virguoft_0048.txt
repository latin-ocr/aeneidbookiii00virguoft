xlii VIRGIL'S AENEm: 111.

a touch of sympathy‚ whatever may be thought of the
genuineness of part of line 661 :—

‘Lanigerae comitantur oves; ea sola voluptas
Solamenque mali ¹.’

More than any other ancient poet has Virgil dwelt on the
purest of human affections, the love of parent and child.
The very shore of Drepanum, where Aeneas loses his father,
is ‘inlaetabilis ora.⁵ What a world of pathos and poetry is
condensed in the few lines that follow (7o9*711)—-

‘ Ileu genitorem, omnis curae casusque levamen,
Amitto Anchisen. Hic me, pater optime, fessum

Edmund Burke, who ‘ had constantly at his elbow a worn

ought to admire3 and if we cannot arrive at this union of
admiration with knowledge, rather to believe that we are
