68 VIRGIL'S AENEID: ΙΙΙ.

11. 420 seqq. In his description os Scylla, virgil follows the later
legend (Ee. vi. 74) which represented this creature as ‘ Half like
a serpent horribly displaide, But th' other halfe did woman's shape
retaiue‚ Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine!
The Scylla of Hom. Od. xii. 85 seqq. is a monster with six heads
and twelve sect. ⁶ Verily she hath twelve feet all dangling down,
and six necks, of a great length, and on each a hideous head, and
therein three rows of teeth set thick and close, full of black
death : up to her middle is she sunk far down in a hollow cave, but
she holds forth her heads from out the dread gulf, and there she
sishes, groping round the rocks, for dolphins and sea-dogs' (Butcher
and Lang). The Myth of Scylla and Charybdis may have
originated in tales about the strong currents which sweep round the
coast near Faro on a change of tide. This current is now called the
(larosblo (Carnation) from its circular shape. Milton’s picture of
Sin owes much to virgil, cp. P. L. ii. 648:

‘ Before the gates there sat
On either side a formidable Shape.
The one seemed woman to the waist, and sair,
But ended foul in many a sealy sold,
Voluminous and vast—a serpent armed
With morta} sting. About her middle round
A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked
With wide Cerberean mouths full lond, and rung
A hideous peal3 .

. . Far less abhorred than these
Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts
Calabria srom the hoarse Trinacriam shore.'

inplacata, ‘ insatiable.'

1. 421. ter: this too is vague. Hom. says ‘thrice in the day,'
‘Mighty Charybdis sueks down black water, sor thrice a day she
spouts it forth, and thriee a day she sucks it down in terrible wise,⁸

gurgite: local abl‘, ‘ in the deep waters os its abyss.'

1. 422. sorbet, ‘draws the waves down her gulf.’

abruptum ι a neut. adj. used as a subst., cp. 1. 232 11., and Milton,
l’. L. ii. 408 τ
‘ Upborne with indefatigable wings
Over the vast Abrupt.’

1. 426. prima: though an adj. is used adverbially (cp. 1. 310 11.),
as Virgil's original, Lucr. v. 905 (‘ prima leo, postrema (Iram, media
ipsa Chimaera ') shows——‘ above, os human shape '; cp. Milton² ‘ up-
ward woman, And downward fish.’

l. 427. pistrix, ‘a whale.’ Pistris is the name os a ship in v.
116.
