INTRODUCTION. xxxi

sustulit! But Juno withdraws Turnus from the fight in
pursuit of a phantom Aeneas3 and the fierce Mezentius
spreads destruction among the Trojans and his former
subjects. He is wounded by Aeneas, but saved by the
intervention of his son Lausus—too good sor such a sire.
Then the brave youth falls by the hand of Aeneas, and
the fierce old king speaks to his horse, the only other
being that he loved ¹, ‘Rhaebe‚ diu, res si qua diu mortal-
ibus ulla est, viximus,’ and charges against the slayer of
his son. Aeneas kills the horse, and then the rider, who asks
only that he may be allowed to share his son’s grave.

In the Eleventlc Book we read of the burial of Pallas and
the other slain warriors. Ambassadors bring to Latinus
the depressing tidings that Diomede refused to take arms

tion, the augur Tolumnius hurls a spear and kills one of the
Arcadians. Bare·headed and unarmed Aeneas strives to
stop the battle, but is wounded by an arrow sped by an
unknown hand, and is led aside to be tended by lapis,
But it is the plant dittany that Venus puts into the water
that staunches the blood and enables him to return to the
fight. And now, Juturna‚ under the form of her brother’s
charioteer‚ whirls him hither and thither, as a swallow flies
through a palace hall, while Aeneas ever staunchly pursues.
At last the Trojans through the inspiration of Venus make
for the city; and Amata, thinking Turnus slain, hangs herself
