lacuna here, as Andromache shows by her next question that she
knew os the death of Creusa.

l. 341. tamen, ‘Has he any care for his mother after all though
lost 3 ’ a good instance of the ‘ compensatory use ' os lamm3 cp. Plaut.
Capt. ii. 3. 44 ‘in tantis aerumnis tamen'; Catull. lxviii. 118 ‘qui
tamen indomitum ferre iugum docuit‚’ ‘who taught him to bear
the yoke after all, though untameable.'

1. 348. multum: the adverbial aec. is rare when the predicate
is not a simple verb, but lacrimas fundit is equivalent in sense
to lacrimat. Ribbeck thinks this line a duplicate of 1. 344, as ‘ tears '
are inconsistent with laetus (l. 347), but, as Henry pertinently in-
quires elsewhere, ‘are tears ofjoy unknown in Ge1‘many2'

l. 349. simulata, ‘a miniature Troy, a Pergamum imitating the
great one.'

T 1. 3150. arentem: and so sar unlike the ‘ eddying stream ’ of the

l. 354. aulai z this arehaic gen. for -ac is found in Virgil only in the

Lucretius admitted it occasionally in adjectives; ep. ii. 52 ‘ purpureai’3
iii. 689 ‘'gelidai’; iv. 537 ‘nigrat’

The aula here means the atrium, the central room, where the
Romans received their guests.

Bacchi, ‘ wine.'

l. 356. ‘ Day after day passed on.’ The rhythm suggests the
lingering tSidgwick).

l. 357. aurae vela vocant : in iv. 417 there is the converse

expression, vocat iam carbasus auras, where it is the wind that
lingers.

ssax, e. g. ‘a sail,’ as here.

l. 358. vatem, ‘the secr,' Helenus. quaeso: antiquated form of
quaero.
