BOOK 111. 17

incassum fletus, cum sese a moenibus heros 345
Priamides multis Helenus comitantibus adfert
adgnoscitque suos laetusque ad limina ducit,

et multum lacrimas verba inter singula fundit.
Procedo, et parvam Troiam simulataque magnis
Pergama et arentem Xanthi cognomine rivum 350
adgnosco Scaeaeque amplector limina portae.

Nec non et Teucri socia simul urbe fruuntur.

Illos porticibus rex accipiebat in amplis:

aulai medio libabant pocula Bacchi

inpositis auro dapibus paterasque tenebant. 355

Day aster day passes by, and the sair wind sumneons them to the
deep. Basore departing‚ Aeneas consults Helenus as prophct os
Apollo. After sacrifice the king, feeling the inspimtion of the god,
proclaims that he will tell them some things that will enable Aeneas
with more sasety to settle in Italy, whithcr he is being led by the gods.
‘ Italy seems near, bnt long and hard is thejourmy that separatas you
from it. The Sicilian and Ansonian Seas must youfirst sail over ‚·
the lake that leads to the world below, and the island of the enchann-ess
Cirse must you pass, before yon can found a m'ty. A sign is given
loyou. When you find a white sow with thirty white young ones
Iying on the shore, then will your rest be assurcd. Fear no! the
prophecy of “eating tablcs '' .· the F ates will find a way and Apollo
will be at hand to bless. Cruel Greeks occupy all the ncarer parts os
Italy, so that, when you cross and are offering sacrifice on the shore
opposite, you must cover your head with a purple robe lest the sace
os a soe should break the spc·ll.‘ then you approach the coast os
Sicily and the ‚Strait os Pelorus opens out on your right, you nmst
turn to the left so as to sail southwards and coast round Sicily. The·
struit is beset by Scylla on the right and Charybdis on the left. A hove
all things pray to Juno. then you reach Cumae consult the Sibyl,
and beg that she herself ulter her prophecies and do not enlrnst
them to leaves, the sport os the wind. She will direct your course.
Ftnvwell. Raise the glor-y of Troy to {he stans)

qui tripodas Clarii et laurus, qui sidera sentis 360
