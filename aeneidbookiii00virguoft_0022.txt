alluding to her son, who had but recently died (‘ Tu Marcellus
eris,' &c.‚ Aen vi. 883 sqq), that she fainted, and was with
difficulty revived. She ordered a royal guerdon to be given
to the poet.

Virgil proposed to devote three years to the completion of
the Acnefd, and aster that to spend the remainder of his life
in the study of philosophy. But ‘vitae summa brevis spem
nos vetat incohare longam.’ In 19 ΒΟ. he journeyed to
Greece to review the scenes of his hero’s wanderings, having
instructed Varius, if anything should happen to him, to destroy
all of the poem that was not already beyond recall. At
Athens he met Augustus, who induced him to return in his
company to Italy. A sever contracted at Megara shattered
a constitution that had long been delicate, and the great
poet breathed his last a few days after landing at Brun-
disium, on 21 Sept„ 19 B. C. He was buried about two miles
from Naples, where his tomb was long an object of super-

been written by himself :—

‘ Mantua me genuit; Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc
Parthenope: cecini pascua, rura, duces'3

where Calabri stands for Brundisium, Parthenope sor
Naples, and the last three words for the Bucolt'cs, Georgics,
and Aeneid. On his deathbed, we are told, Virgil desired
that the Aeneid should be burned‚ or at any rate the portion
that he had not already made known, which probably
appeared unfinished to his fastidious taste. Happily
Augustus forbade this, and entrusted its publication to
Varius and Tucca, with instructions not to add anything‚
not even to fill up the incomplete lines, which, as Vir-gil
said, he had put in ‘ as props till the marble columns should
arrive.’

His method of composition was to dictate a number of
lines and then condense these, polishing them with extreme

is he could but steal along with them his voice with its wondrous

charrn and his power of expressive delivery. ( )
