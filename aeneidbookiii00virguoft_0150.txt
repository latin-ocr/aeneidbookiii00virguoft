enable the student to appreciate the contrast :—

A.

Over the Ι sea‚past Ι Crete on the Ι Syrian Ι shore to the Ι southward,
Dwellsin the 1 well-tilled llowland a Ι dark-haired Ι Aethiop Ι people,
Skilful with Ι needle and Ι loom, and the Ι arts of the! dyer and Ι earver,
Skilsul, but Ι seeble of¹ heart: for they Ι know not the Ι Lords of
Oll m us,
Lovers {fllium ; neither Ι broad-browed Ι Zeus nor Ι Pallas Aithene,
Teaeher osi wisdom to heroes, be'stower of {might in the Ι battle3
Share not the Ι cunning of Hermes, nor Ι list to the ] songs of Aipollo.
KINGSLEY.

B.

In the old Ι Colony {days‚ in Ι Plymouth the lland os the Ι pilgrims
To and Ι fro in a Ι room of his Ι simple and lprimitive [dwelling‚
Clad in Ι doublet and Ι hose, and Ι boots of Ι Cordovan Ι leather,
Strode with a Ι martial Ι air, Miles Ι Standish the Ι Puritan Ι Captain.
LONGFELLOW.

lt will be noticed that the metre adopted by the late Lord
Bowen in his translation *a striking attempt at the almost
hopeless task of adequately rendering Virgiſtris really hexa-
meter with the last syllable removed, and rhyme added. In
fact, as he says, it is as if the line Coleridge translated from

Schiller—

In the hexjameter Ι rises the Ι sountain's Ι silvery Ι column,

were to become—

Iu the hexlameter Ι rises the Ι fountain's Ι silvery Ι spray.

Professor Tyrrell justly condemns the change as taking
away the character of the hexameter. ⁴ It is either no metre
at all, or it is the metre which Swinburne has used so grandly
in the ‘⁴ Song in Time of Revolution ’'u-

‘ “ The heart ofthe rulers is siek, and the High Priest covers his head,
F‘flcffgiffi is the song of the quick which is heard in the ears of the

‘But Swinburne has emphasized the division of the line
into two parts by the internal rhyme. Had Lord Bowen
consistently observed this rule, his poem would be in ana-
paestic measure.’ But though the balked suggestion of the
classieal metre may offend Professor Tyrrell's sensitive ear,
even he does not deny that the translation is a beautiful
