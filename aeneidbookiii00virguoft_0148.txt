98 leGIL's AENEm: 111.

foot is due to the long Greek word, as is the case in 680,
where the rhythm is similar.

l. 702 ‘Inmanisque Gella fluvili cognomine dicta! There
is no parallel to the uncontracted form fluvii in Virg., and
the lengthening of the a in Gela is strange, if it is the
nominative. 1 think Gela is the Greek gen. (Thuc. vi. 4. 3),
and fluvii a correct gloss upon it. 1f so, a word has fallen out
and we should perhaps read ‘Inmanisque Gela cognomine
maenia dicta.’ ,llam-‘cz would more easily be lost after the final
part of the foregoing word.

10. A few other points may be noticed :—

l. 3 A cretic (-υ-) is not usually elided, but Ilium has the
licence of a proper name, which otherwise could not be intro-
duced into hexaineters. The city Traia is a dissyllable‚ but
Τνῡῖιι in 306 and 596 comes from the adj. Troius.

l. 36 νίίῦς cf. simi 204, infilmff, 628, indi, 663. These
must not be confused with adverbs from adjs. of the second
decl. which have ἒ (except bc‘ne', mam, and a few others).

l. 45 ego'. Very few words have final ὅ in Virg.; ιίπό, 623,
112151l‹5(adv.)‚ 116, ,τείιῇ 602, and nescis), are the most common.
Later there was an increasing tendency to shorten final ο.

l. 46 ςιῖξιῖςε the final es is short in such words when the
stein has short vowel, milffs, mx'lflz's‚ but merem, -Fdz's, so lele,
-lirisffiffl, νίν-1173, filis, διο.

l. 112 nblmns: lzl‘nc Ι. The us is lengthened by arsis,
(where the voice is raised at the metrica} ictus), helped by
the pause at the chief caesura.

l. 122 dacem, but the verb α’νῖιυ, Ιῐ4; for such variations
compare sdfiar, 173, but sffijn'sm‘; vbccm, 246, but vffrare, 185;
sides, 12 3, but sffdetu rigis, but rffgo.

l. 192 iam elided, cf. 205, 260. Monosyllables ending in
a long vowel or m should not be elided before a slmrl
vowel.

l. 212 Hv‘fiyiae (— — —) ; Phineia (—— ψ ψ) : Greek words.

l. 218 saum, being of fifth decl. in abl.

l. 257 vaila) cheek‚' mdlus‚‘bad‚ 'mdlns (m), ‘1nast‚' malus
(f), ⁴ apple—tree,‘ malum, ‘apple.'

1. 314 sribicio: u is lengthened before l> and lost seinivowel i.

1. 363 relegio: the ἑ in this word and in rdiquiae, 87, is
probably due to metrical necessity; in reddo it may be due
to feast, the old forn] of νὼ, seen in redeo. Ι η repperis, rel-sidu,
sellulis, it is perhaps a relic of the reduplicated perfect.

l. 364 7¹epos(i)las ς for the omission of the short vowel
compare 07‘ac(2t)lum‚ 143, fierscfflVss, 711.

l. 440 misffire‘, 2nd pers sut. pass. (nn'ltffre, infin. active).
