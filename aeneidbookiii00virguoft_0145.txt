APPENDIX 11. 95

last are dactyls) are common (see Aen. iii. 195, 351, 413,
489, 666), especially in Greek, and spcmdal'c lines <where the
fifth foot is a spondee) ar'e not very rare, we generally find a
mixture of the two kinds of feet in the first four places.

3. The metrical scius, which must be distinguished from the
accen! of a word, falls on the first syllable of the soot in a
dactylic measure like the hexameter; but a inere collection
os words which could be divided into feet would not neces-
sarily make a rhythmical line. Take for example—

‘Sparsis Ι hastis Ι loiigis Ῑ campus Ι splendet et ἶ horret.¹

This consists of four spondees, a dactyl and a spondee:
and yet it can scarcely be read as an hexameter. lt was an
attempt to get a special effect, but even the ancients laughed
at it. Contrast with it—

‘Densanlti'n‘ camlpis hor]rentia Ι tela vilrorum?

What makes this rhythmical? We notice that the second and
third feet are broken between two words, that they have each
what is called a caesura (‘ cutting’)‚ and that this feature is
lacking in the former line. But why should this cause such
a difference? To understand this, we must recall the rule of
the accent in Latin.

4. Stated broadly, the rule of the accen! in Latin is this : If
the penult of a word be long, the accent is on it, but is the
penult be short, the accent is on the antepenult. Of course
there follows from this that (except in monosyllables> the
accent in Latin never falls on the last syllable of a word.
Now we notice that in the first os the two lines the acute
mark (which points out the metrical ictus) falls on the
syllable which has the natural accent of the word; so there
is nothing to suggest to the ear that we are not reading
prose. Let us by the grave mark point out the natural
accents of the words in the second line—

‘Densari'tur campis horrentia tela virorum?

We now see that the aecent does not coincide with the
ictus in the first three feet, but does coincide in the last
three feet: that, in fact, the caesura silifflly causes the icfrtg
{9-[311 on a syllable—[hat has not the accffl. We also notice
that this divergenee between ictus and accent occurs in the

 

syllable before the elided syllable is long, making the sixth soot
a spondee. Hypermeter is unknown in Greek. where the last sylla-
ble was probably a trochee (- u), a catalectic dactyl.
