11. lt is only when we have become familiar with the
rhythm of the hexameter, and can without effort appreciate
its music, that we can recognize the wonderful skill with
which Virgil introduced variety into its harmony. This he
effected‚ not only by the occasional use of Greek rhyssrm, but
by constantly changing the arrangement of the dactyls and
spondees ir. the first four feet. His favourite collocation is
a dactyl followed by three spondees. As compared with
Ovid he uses spondees more frequently in all the four
positions. We may realize how much dignity is thus added
to the heroic verse by comparing it with his own Bucolics,
where the lighter theme has appropriately a larges number of
dactyls. Note caresully, t00‚ how often the mctre expresses
the sense. What massive weight is shown in such lines as—

‘Urgeri mole hae, ingentemque insuper Aetnam.’ (579.)

what murky obscurity in—

‘ Et lunam in nimbo nox intempesta tenebat.' (5873

What size and horror are suggested by——

‘ Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum-⁷ &6583

with its strident elisions and harsh spondees.
Contrast with these the speed os*

‘ Vela damus vastumque cava trabe currimus aequor.‘ (191)

and the wild rush of—

‘Noctem hiememque ferens, et inhorruit unda tenebris? (195 i

and the sad pathos os—

‘O mihi sola mei snper Astyanactis imago? (489)

Again Virgil, like all Latin poets‚ is fond of ‘apt allitera-
tion’s artsul aid.' For striking examples the following lines
should be studied, and the varied effects cannot but be selt:
102, 160, 196, 216, 283, 529. 555, 623.

12. English hexameters can give but a saint idea of their
rhythmic roll, sor English has not adopted the quantitative
system. Indeed, until the ear has been trained, we can
scarcely recognize the metre in Kingsley's Andromeda, the
finest poem in this metre in English, or in Longsellow's
