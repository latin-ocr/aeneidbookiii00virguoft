86 VIRGIL'S AENEID : 111.

Achaemenides was not with him then. This line is, probably, not
from Virgil's pen.

l. 690. errata, ‘ passed by in his former wanderings' with Ulysses;
cp. Ov. F. iv. 573 ‘ erratas terras,’ and 1. 191 n.

l. 692. Sicanio . . . sinu: the great harbour of Syracuse (now
Porto illaggz'orc f).

1. 693. Plemurium undosum: sor the epithet explaining the
etymology of the subject cp. 1. 40² n.‚ the name being connected with
πλημμυρίς, ‘ a tide? Cape Plemyrium (the modern Massolivieri) is
a roeky promontory which forms one extremity of the narrow entrance
(1,300 yards wide), immediately south of the point of Ortygia.

l. 694. Ortygiam, ‘quail island,' the original settlement of Archias,
within which the modern city is included. It is probable that the
name was derived from the cult of Diana, who was connected with
the original Ortygia (Delos).

l. 695. Hence Ortygia was hailed by Pindar (Nem. i. 1) as
‘holy vent of Alpheus ’ ; cp. Milton (Arcades, 30):

⁴ Divine Alpheus, who by secret sluice
Stole under seas to meet his Arethusess

l. 696. ore tuo: ‘who now passes out through thy mouth,
O Arethuse, and mingles with the Sicilian Sea ’ς the fountain
Arethuse is so near the sea that its overflow, even at the present day,
issues into the great harbour.

Arethusa, ‘the huntress nymph Arethusa was loved by the hunter
Alpheus, and to avoid his wooing she sled to Ortygia and became
a spring. Alpheus, through a sort of sympathetic charm, was
transformed into a river, which ssowed beneath the sea and united its
waters with the spring ’ (Bury on Pind. loc. cin).

l. 698. exsupero, ‘I pass by'3 cp. i. 244.
stagnantis Helori, from ἕλος, a marsh, is another instance of
the constr. explained in l. 693 n. Helorus rises in the mountains

and, aster a rapid descent, spreads· over the plains near the sea. In
modern times, the upper stream is called Atellam, the lower Abz'sso.

l. 699. Pachynus 2 the modern Passaro.

l. 700. fatis, ‘Camarina, which the oracle gave no man leave
to disturb' (Con.). An allusion to the oraele ‘do not disturb
Camarina: better is it that she should be undisturhed,' which
became proverbial (r-‘it is better to let sleeping dogs lie‘), the
legend being that the inhabitants, in defiance of the warning of the
oracle, ‹lrained the marsh round their town, thus making the place
accessible to the enemy who before suffered from malarial sever
during these sieges. This marsh is still called Lago di Camarina.

l. 702. inmanis: a genit.‚ ‘ called from the name of its violent
stream' (viz. Gelas, now called Fiume di Gln'ovtzom cp. Ov. F. iv.
