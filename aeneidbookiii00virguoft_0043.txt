INTRODUCTION. xxxvii

What is the reason Anchises gives sorhis false interpretation
os the oraclo? lle surmised that Apollo intended Crete,
because from thence the worship of the (lreat Mother was
brought to Troy. What associations would this arouse in
a Roman's mind ! How his heart would re-echo the loving
repetition of his country’s name in 5254! When such an
army of passages in which the warp and woof is patriotism
can be drawn from one book, which naturally does not give
much scope for such a spirit, we cannot wonder at those who
termed the poem ‘ (festa Populi Romam?

11. In reading quickly through the book mainly to pick
out manifestations of Roman spirit, I noted references to the
following passages which struck me as instances of power-
ful description or picturesque beauty. There is a grue-
some realism in the accounts¹ of Polydorus' grave, of the
harpies, and of Polyphemus in the cave, which, though
powerful‚ is displeasing to modern taste. So wonderfully
modern is Virgil in his cultured gendeness, that we con-
stantly sorget that we have no right to judge him by such
a standard. Still it would be easy to find similar horrors,
with more revolting details, in most great poets—Spenser,
F. Q. 1. i. XV, and Milton, P. L. ii towards the end, are the
first instances that occur to ine—and Virgil has never for-
feited his claim to the noble eulogyof Bacon as ‘the chastest
poet and the royalest that to the memory of man is known.’

Lines 1247 seem to me very picturesque, and 1 can scarcely
tell why. In reading them one seems to be speeding in
a smoothly-gliding boat aniid the ‘ shining Cyclades,’ and
almost to catch a glimpse of the bacchant revels² on Naxos
and to feast his eyes on green Donusa.

Then the moonlit vision in 147 sqq„ is there not some-
thing in it that recalls Keats' Eve 0sSl. Agnes?

‘Full on this caseincnt shone the wintry moon.

¹ See lines 26-33, ²²5-235s and 620-627.

² bacchatam is one of the ‘ lonely words’ by which virgil lends
a human interest to scenery: cf. G. ii. 487 ‘Virginibus bacchata
Lacaenis Taygeta? ⁴ Cedentia ’ in 496 is another such word.
