NOTES. 81

before the apodosis. There are but three other examples of such a
lieence (in the second soot) in Virgil; cp. (;. i. 4 : iv. 343. 463.

l. 607. genibus, ‘ at my knees ’ ; local abl.
volutans, ‘ grovelling‚' used intransitively.

l. 608. qui sit: quis is always used in direct questions. qui as well
as quis in indirect. Others read quis sil, as a more limited question.

Ι. 609. deinde, ‘ to consess what Subsequent sortunes harass him ';
so Conington: but it seems better to connect deinde with hortamur
understood (I'age*, ‘ Then we bid him tell what is his history.r

l. 610. multa: cognate acc.

l. 611. praesenti, ‘ reassures him with potent pledge’ viz. the
grasp of his hand). For this meaning of praeseus cp. p. armiliam.

l. 614. genitore Adamasto, ‘ I went to Troy, leaving my father
Adamastus who was poor'; the abl. absol. implies that his father
sent him on account of his poverty. Hence mansisset, etc.. ‘ would
that Ι had been content with rny humble condition.’

l. 616. For the adventures of Ul>sses in the Cyclops‘ cave cp.
Hom. Od. ix. 216 seqq.

dum: notice that dum is usually followed by the pres. indic„
even in speaking os past time.

l.617. inmemores: probably stronger than ‘forgetsul‚' as is
shown by Catull. xxx. 1 ‘Alfene inmemor atque unanimis salse
sodalibus‚' ‘ thou traitor.'

l. 618. sanie, ‘a house of gore and bloody feasts'; a bold de-
scriptive abl. which in sense is the predicate of the sentence. Domus
sanie would be bad Latin. llere some adj„ e.g. foeda, must be
supplied (by zeugma) from dapibus cruentis.

l. 619. pulsat, ‘he bumps the stars with his head‚’ a forcible phrase,
stronger than Hor. Od. i. 1. 36 ‘sublimi seriam sidera vertice)

l. 621. visu facilis, ‘ agreeable to see'; cp. (ἱ. ii. 223. The
supine in -u is usual after an adj.

adfabilis, ‘ courteous.'

l. 623. From llom. Od. ix. 288, ‘ He sprang up, and laid his hands
upon my fellows, and clutching two together dashed them, as they
had been whelps, to the earth, and the brain llowed forth upon the
ground, and the earth was wet.'

l. 624 resupinus. As Homer says the Cyclops ‘ sprang up) some
editors think that this adj. means ‘ bending back ' so as to gather up
his full force, but perhaps Servius's explanation is more satisfactory ,³
‘ virgil describes his gigantic strength: *⁶ he seizes two with one hand,
ns he lay on his back at his ease, not dashing them against the
ground, but upon the rocks of the roof.’' ’

l. 625. From Od. ix. 458, ‘'l'hen should he be smitten. and his
brains be dashed against the fluor here and there about the cave.'
