xxii VIRGIL'S AENEm: 111.

possible for the Roman poet to avoid such reference to his
models. Was he to shut himself off from a large portion of
his material—to confine himself to the observation of nature,
and neglect all that could be derived from culture, all the
resources of tradition? Under such conditions an epic poem
at all events would be impossible. We must remember, too,
how large a part of a Roman's education consisted in
the study of Greek¹ authors. This is what is meant by the
epithet ‘dorlztsss applied, for example, to Catullus. While
he greatly excelled his models, he still ‘ imitated ’ the Alexan-
drine poets, who had themselves copied from the early Greek
masters. Even when we go back to Homer himself] it is
impossible to say how much use he made of earlier ballads,
but we may be certain that the Iliad and Odyssey arethe
culmination, and not the beginning, of a literature.

This charge has been revived during the present century in
the controversy which threatened to depose Virgil from the
throne of influence which he has occupied for eighteen
centuries in the mind os civilized man. A closer examination
of it will enable us to form a juster estimate of Virgil. In
the first place, no poet of Virgil’s time would have dreamed
of composing an epic in any but hexameter verse ². Now the
hexameter is manifestly derived from Homer: we can trace its
development in Latin from its ruggedness in Ennius, which
betrayed its recent adoption, through the increased vigour
and finer harmony of Lucretius, till, in Virgil's hands, it attain-
ed such perfection that Tennyson addresses him as ⁴ wielder

¹ ‘Graecia capta serum victorem cepit, et artes

Intulit agresti Lati0,‘

says Horace (Ep. ii. 1. 156), and he goes on to pay a just tribute to
the original powers of the Roman :

‘Et placuit sibi, natura sublimis et acer:
Nam spirat tragicum satis et feliciter audet.' (lb. 165.)

Care in revision was the one thing wanting. as he complains here and
in AP. 287. virgil certainly had no lack os this care. Sec also
