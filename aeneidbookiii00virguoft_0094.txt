introduced by —Jue or ct, cp. ll. 9-10 n.

1. 91. liminaque: for the ictus on a short syllable cp. G. i. 371
⁶ Eurique Zephyriquc.' This license‚ which occurs in virgil sixteen
times, always before double consonants except in the present pass,
G. 1. c. and A. xii. 363, is justified by such Homeric lines as Λάμπον
τε Κλύτιόν τε. Homer lengthens such syllables only before double
cmmonants, liquids, and sibilants, and the liquid l is sufficient justifi-
cation here. It must be remembered that a second que always follows.

limina, ‘the threshold of the shrine’ ; cp. 371.
l. 92. Mons: viz. Mount Cynthus.

cortina, ‘the bell-shaped cover of the tripod.' IIence Ennius
speaks of the ‘cava cortina’ (vault) of heaven.

which your ancestors inhabited.’

l. 95. ubere laeto: an obscure allusion to Italy, whose ulm-
(ὅ fruitsul bosom ') was famous3 cp. i. 531; ii. ’7823 iii. 164.

ll. 97—8. A translation of the famous lines, Hom. Il. xx. 307, ‘But
now shall the might of Aeneas reign among the Trojans, and his chil-
dren's children, who shall be born in aster time.⁷ It may be noted
that virgil, by substituting cmzctis . . . oris for ‘ Trojans, has con-
verted a “prediction of the supreinacy of Aeneas and his family in
a revived Phrygiam Troy into a promise ofthe Roman Empire ' (Con).
However, this misinterpretation does not date from virgil, as the
Schol. on Il. l. c. mentions an ancient reading ‘But now shall the
race of Aeneas reign over all? The abl. cunctis . . . oris is local ⁶ 011

monimenta, ‘traditions stored in the memorics of agcd rnen ';
cp. Plaut. Trin. ii. 2. 100 ‘ Historiam veterem atque antiquam
hacc mea senectus sustinet.' Hence the regular phrase sor ‘ since
the dawn of history ‘ was ‘ post hominum memorimn.’ For monimenta
=‘records.' cp. Catull. xi. 10 ‘ Caesaris visens monimenta magni,
‘ records of Caesar's triumphs.’ Mr. Page compares Ps. xliv. 1, ‘ We
have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us.’
