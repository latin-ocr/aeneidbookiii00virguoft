NOTEs. 77

Herculei, si vera est fama: shows that the claim of Hercules
to be called the founder of· Tarentum was but dubious. The more
familiar legend ascribed the origin os the city to Taras, the son ol
Poseidon, but the Spartan I’halanthus, a descendant os Hercules,
was said to have settled there subsequently : hence Horace¹s linc (Od.
iii. 5. 56) ‘ aut Lacedaemonium Tarentum)

¹ l. 552. attollit: this must mark a period long subsequent to
cernitur, as Lacinia is more than 80 miles across the (siulf os
Tarentum, from the Iapygian promontory.

Lacinia: the Lacinian promontory 15 now called Cape delle
Colonne, from the pillars of the ancient Tfmplum sunonis Laciniae,
of which one still stands upon its summit. For Lacinia =‘tc1nple
of Lacinia‚' cp. l. 275 n.

l. 553. Scylaceum [the modern Sqm'llacc, in the gulf os the same
name), perched on au almost inaccessible mck, would become
visible long before Caulon <the modern Castelwtere' , as the view ofthe
latter is obstructed by the neighbouring promontory di Stilo. Virgil’s
knowledge of these waters is accurate, for the towering conev of Aetna
is outlined in the haze and seems to ‘rise out of the waves' after
passing Caulon. Some time must have elapsed between lines 554
and 555, as the Straits of Messina are not ‘ opened‚' until Leucopetra
(Capo dell’ Armi) is weathercd.

l. 555 seqq. ‘The grande-st description with which 1 am acquaiuted
‹gg'apegklfipsyghe grandest object in nature, the roaring os an agitated

fractas, ‘ and the broken (i. e. ‘ not continuous ’) sounds upon the
shores’; cp. G. iv. 71 ‘vox auditur.sractos sonitus imitata tubarum.'
brililton, P. L. ii. 661 ‚ seems to translatefi·m·tas, ‘the lumrsc Triuacrian
s ore.

l. 557. exsultant, ‘the still waters below boil up, and sand and
sursare commingled.’ Exsultarc is used os a kettle. vii. 464 ‘ exsultant-
que aestu latices ’; sor the whole line cp. 1. 125 ‘imis stagna refusa
vadis‚’ and ibid. 107 ‘ furit aestus harenis’

l. 558. haec illa.. ‘this is the Charybdis os which Helenus spoke'
(cp. 11. 410 seqq.) ; the first pron. is demonstrative. the second em-
phatic. Notice the attraction of the first pron. to the gender os the
predicate, in aecordance with the Latin rule. For an exception
cp. l. 173 n.

1. 559. canebat : cp. l. 15511.

l. 560. eripite, sc. vos periculis. The omission of the pers.
pron. is common in vulgar speech, and effective here in a moment
os excitement; cp ‘Rescuel’

1. 561. ae: cp. 1. 236 n.

rudentem, ‘the roaring pr0w,' 15 a daring description os the
effect os a sudden and violent wrench os the tiller iu a stormy
sea.
