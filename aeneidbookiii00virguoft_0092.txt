had calmed the seas, and the south wind gently whispering summons
us to the deep, our companions haul down the ships.'

ubi prima=7tbiprz'1lzmu; cp. i. 723 ‘postquam prima quies

311 ‘dat motus’ κ moveam-3 v. 347 ‘dare ruinas‚’ ‘to fall? dizre
pausam. In such phrases dare :facerey and it is possible that the
Romans connected this clo with the -do of credo, abdo, condo.

The winds are osten spoken of as the powers that calm the sea;
cp. Ec. ii. 26 ‘ cum placidum ventis staret mare.’ The explanation
of the idiom is to be found in Milton, P. L. i. 1 71 ‘The sulphurous hail

have been more usual, cp. G. iv. 370 ‘saxosusque sonans Hypanis';

vowelsl cp. G. i. 281 ‘Ter sunt conati imponere Pelio Ossam‚’

e.g. Catull. lxiv. 15 ‘ aequoreae monstrum Nereides admirantes.’

Aegaeo. Neptune was specially worshipped at Aegae in Euboea ;
ep. Hom. 11. xiii. 21. ‘ Three strides he (Poseidon) made, and with
the fourth he reached his goal, even Aegae, and there was his famous

l. 75. quam : viz. Delos.

pius, ‘ compassionate and affectionate' towards thc island, on
