11. THE AENEID.

It is a commonplace that all Latin Literature from the
time of Ennius1, with the doubtful exception of Satire ², is
imitative. To Virgil his Pastomls were ‘versus Syracusius ’
(i. e. Theocritean‚ Bne. vi. 1), his &effigia-s, carmen Ascraeum
(i.e. modelled on Hesiod os Ascra, Geor. ii. 176 . He praises
Pollio's fraga-dics as ‘Sophocleo . . . digna cothurno’ (Bm. viii.
10), which Horace (C. ii. 1. 121 mentions as ‘grande munus
Cecropio (i. e. Athenian) . . . cothurno! So Horace 4( ”. i. 6. 2)
speaks of the epic Varius as a bird ‘Mac-amu* carminis' (of
Homeric song ν, and his own lyrz'cs as ‘carmen Aeolium ' tin
the style of Alcaeus and Sappho: Plautus with charming
insouciance laments that there could be ‘slmnd ' few comedies
with as pure a plot as the Captivi. So too in prose. Cicero's
philosophica] works, for example, are prosessedly attempts
to bring Greek philosophy within the reach os his own people.
The effect of this has been to render us too prone to de-
preciate the merits of the Latins. ‘O imitatores, servum
pecus ! ’ we exclaim with Horace, quite sorgctting that in the
next few lines the claim he puts forward to originality is --

‘ Parios ego primus iambos
Ostendi Latio, numeros animosque secutus
Archilochi.’
Adverse critics assailed the Ama-id, almost as soon as it
appeared, on this very ground, arguing that the amount ol
reproduction of Homeric phrases implied a want os original
power. Vir‘gil’s own answer that ‘it was easier to steal his
club from Hercules than a verse from Homer ’ may be deemed
sufficient reply to such detractors. Or we may ask is it were

¹ Ennius (239-169 B.C.) introduced Greek learning and melus
into Latin Literature. His Annales is the earliest Latin hexamcm
poem. He was the younger contemporary os Naevius, the last reprc-
sentative of indigenous Italian poetry‚ who wrote an epic on the

first Punic war in Saturnian verse.
² ‘Satira tota nostra est,' says Quintilium but this refers chiefly

to sorm, since its spirit, as Horace admits, is derived from the old
Athenian comedy.
