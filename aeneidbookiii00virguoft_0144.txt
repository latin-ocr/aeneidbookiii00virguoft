METRE.

1. The old Latin poetry depended on the regular recurrence
of arcens, like English poetry and not, as the Greek, on the
quanlilz'es of syllables. Specimens survive in the fragments
of the Saturnian metre of Naevius¹. A younger contern-
porary of his. Q. Ennius (239-169 Β. C), born at Rudiae, in
Calabria, and so influenced by the Greek associations of the
south of Italy, which was called Magna Graecia. came to
Rome at the end of the Second Punic VVar and introduced
Greek metres‚ which were henceforth used by all Latin
poets.

2. Amongst these metres the most important was the Hem-
meter, which had been used in the Iliad and Odyssey and
other epics, in Hesiod's didactic poetry, and in the pastoral
idylls of Theocritus. It consists of six feet, which may all be
either spondees (— —) or dactyls (— υ ψ), except the last,
which is a spondee 2; the fifth foot is nearly always a dactyl.
Hence we have the following scheme (the last syllable being
treated as indeterminate) :—

¹ Macauhy, in the Presace to The Lays [ff Anct'cnt Rome, points
out the identity os the old Saturnian metre with the old English
ballad. Compare—

, ‘novem Iovis conco'rdes Ι filiae sorores‚'

Ἠῶ ‘ The king was in his parlour 1 counting out his ino11ey.'

2 So the Latius thought, regarding the last syllable, the syllaba
ansep5, as long. This appears from their hypermefrl'c lines in
which a final syllable, generally que, is elided before a vowel
beginning the next line. In sixteen out of eighteen cases in virgil, the
