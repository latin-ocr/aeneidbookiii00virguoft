probably to avail himself os their criticism, sor we lind
Propertius (ii. 34) writing not long aster <probably about
25 B.C.) the well-known exaggerated encomium :—

‘Cedite Romani scriptoreS, cedite Grai;
Nescio quid maius nascitur Iliade)

The preceding lines seem to show that Propertius at any
rate regarded the Aeneid as a fulfilment os the promise to
sing the glory os Augustus. The words,

‘Actia Vergilium [iuvet] custodis litora l’hoebi
Caesaris et sortes dicere posse rates‚'

are described as depicted by Vulcan on the shield os Aeneas.
Propertius goes on to speak in glowing language os the
Bucolics and Gemgscs ². It is noticeable that V irgil's same

poets that their sriendship remained unbrokeu‚and that Varius
should have had a large share in giving to the world the great

The next incident of the poet's life that has come down to
us is his reading three books of the Aeta-sd to Augustus.
These were the Ft'rsl ( or Second), the fourth and Sia-th.
Octavia, sister of the Emperor, was present at the recita-
