first half of the line. So, granted the right number of
syllables in the right order, on the caesura depends the
rhythm and music.

5. The caesum is ‘strong‚’ if it occur after the first long
syllable of the spondee or dactyl; ‘weak,’ if it occur aster the
first short syllable of the dactyl. It is called ‘Tri-hemi-
· meral‚’ ‘ Pent-hemimeral,' or ‘Hept-hemimeral‚’ according
as it occurs after three, five, or seven half-feet (ἡμι-μέμη), 1. e.
in the second‚third, or fourth foot. Of these Qsspssmhssffllffleffll
is the most important. lfit be ⁶ strong,⁷ it is sufficient to make
a—'verse rhythmical. In the first loo lines of Aen. iii. there
are only eleven which have not this strong caesura in the
third foot3 these are rendered rhythmical by the combina-
tion of other caesuras.

6. In the latter part of the line, where the ictus should coin-
cide with the accent, there should of course be no strong
caesura : for it is clear that if there were a strong caesura in
the fifth foot‚ the ictus would fall on the final syllable of a
word (which would be unaccented). But the Latins do not
follow the Greeks in their avoidance of a weak or trochaic
caesura in the fourth foot; it is found fifteen times in
Aen. iii. 79, 112, 231, 237, ἃς.

7. Elisson takes place when a word, ending with a vowel
or m, is followed by another word beginning with a vowel.
In this case the final syllable of the former word¹ is cut away
in scanning‚ though not, as in Greek, removed and replaced
by an apostrophe. &Vhen the syllabTe is allowed to stand
and count in scanning, hiatus, or a ‘gaping.’ takes place.

8. The qzmlzl.'sies of syllables can be learned only by
practice. Hence the importance of correct pronunciation in
the classroom. But the rule of posl'lz‘on shows at once the
quantities of many syllables in a line before us. This rule is,
that a vowel naturally short is lengthened, if it comes before
two consonants, unless they are a mute and liquid, in which
case it may remain short, e. g. the gen. of fidles is pdlris or
palrl's 2. (If the vowel is naturally long it must remain long,
e. g. the gen. of unzter must be llldlris.)

A vowel before another vowel in the same word is generally
short, e. g. Αεῖιῑε, Ρνῖιιυιί.

 

¹ Except in the ease osa final vowel or m before cs or cst, when
it is the c of these words that is cut off.

² But a mute at the end of a word before a liquid commeueing
the next must lengthen the final syllable. The quantity of a syllable
is generally spoken of as the quantity of the vowel in the syllable.
