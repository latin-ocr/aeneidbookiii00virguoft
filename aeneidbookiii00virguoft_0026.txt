xx VIRGIL'S AENEm : 111.

—a weakness osten associated with a sensitive poetic nature.
We must not forget that he was naturally a partisan of
Caesar, for not only had his great exploits fired the boyish
enthusiam of the poet, but Julius Caesar was the patron of
Cisalpine Gaul, ancl had in 49 Β. C. bestowed Roman citizen-
ship on its inhabitants, and amongst them Virgil’s father.

The munificence of Augustus and Maecenas, and probably
their estimate of the value of a great poet’s praise, is shown
by Virgil's having at his death left property that is said to
have amounted to some A85‚ooo; and it should be recorded
to his honour that he refused to accept the property osan
exile, which was offered to him by the Emperor. In an age
of moral corruption his sobriquet ‘ Parthenias ’ ¹ was a tribute
to his purity, and reminds us that Milton when at Christ’s
College, Cambridge, was nicknamed ‘The Lady' from the
haughty delicacy of his tastes and moralz. Other features of
resemblance may be found between the two poets in their un-
wearied studiousness which produced such a wealth of
learned allusion in their works, and in the perfection of their
stately ineasures which evokes harmonious effect even from
collections of proper names. Both too lived in convulsive
times; but while Milton was carried awaybythe flood of popular
enthusiasm that swept over a throne, Virgil was but a friendly
spectator while the shattered fragments of a corrupt and
worn-out Republic were being gathered into the grasp of
one powerful hand.

¹ The name is no doubt a punning Greek translation of Virgilius,
but all the commentators agree that it was given him because of
his delicate modesty of sace and character, and Ausonius writes:
‘ Maronem Partheniam (lictum causa pudoris.' But the form
Parthenias in Greek would mean ‘ weakling‚’ what Shakspeare calls
‘the baby of a girl‚’ or the special class at Sparta who, on account
ol* the disgrace of their birth, left their homes. and founded Tarentum.
Parthenius would be the correct form to denote ‘mai‹lenly‚’ but
this name belonged to the native of Nicaea, who was brought to
Rome a prisoner aster the Mithridatio war, and taught Greek to
Virgil and other Romans, and himself wrote erotic poems.
