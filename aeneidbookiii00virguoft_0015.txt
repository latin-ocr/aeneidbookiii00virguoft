INTRODUCTION

 

1. VIRGIL.

THE accounts of Virgil's lise, that can be accepted as
historical‚ are in the main traceable to Suetonius ¹, the cele-
brated biographer of the ‘Twelve Caesars‚‘ who lived in the
times of Trajan and Hadrian, and had access to evidence—²
contemporaneous with the poet. PUBth's ΥΕκΟΙΙΛυξκ·3 MARO
was born at Andes, a district to the east of Mantua, in which
lies the modern village Piet01a⁴, on October 15, 70 stc..

¹ The lives given in the commentaries os Donatus and Probus are
admitted to be mostly derived srom Suetonius, though containing
interpolations aud mistakes.

² e. g., L Varius mentioned Virgil's slowness in composition, and
‘friends of Virgil‘ used to tell how he spoke os ¹ producing verses
unsorrned as a bear's cub, and then licking them into shape.' Melis-
sus, a freedman of Augustus, describes him as slow os speech *like
our own Goldsmith). But the chief authority os Suetonius was
probably the book Against tlte detractor>- os lr'irgil by Asconius
Pedianus, who was born Α. D. 2.

³ Inscriptions, the Greek translitcration, aud the best MSS. antes-t
the correctness of this form. The misspelling siagri! appeais to have
been introduced in the fifth century to support a derivation from
virgo (cf. his nickname Parthenias} or zfe‘rga isle-n. vi), whence
Tennyson speaks of him as ⁶ Golden bough among the branches.’

⁴ The tradition, which identifies Andes with Pietola. is as old as
Dante, but Virgil's mention os hills in such passages ns lim. ix.
7 10 has induced some scholars to sec-k sor his home higher up the
Mincio. The picturesque hill os Vallegio, 15 miles north os
Mantua, would satissy most os the conditions5 but wc must not
sorget that Virgil's descriptions os scene-ry are osten horrowed.
