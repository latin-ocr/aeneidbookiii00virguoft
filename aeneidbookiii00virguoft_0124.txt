1. 508. opaci, ‘the shadowed (with pine forests) hills grow dark ’ 3
an Homeric reminiscence familiarized by Tennyson—

⁴ And the sun fell, and all the land was dark?

opaci is hardly a ‘ stop-gap’ (Henry), as pine forests, which grow
black at nightfall, are the prominent features in a twilight landscape.

l. 509. optatae, ‘ longed for ' ; cp. 1. 132 n.

l. 510. sortiti remos, ‘ those whose lot was the oar '; the difficulty
of this phrase is caused by the absence of the article in Latin.
The land would naturally be optata to those who had slaved at the oar
all day. It is not necessary, with many commentators, to press the
literal sense of the verb as sortia-z· is used, like ‘lot' in English,
without any reference to the actual casting of lot÷; cp. ix. 174
‘ omnis per muros legio, sortita periclum, Ι excubat.’

l. 514. auribus . . . captat, ‘seeks 10 catch with his ear the air,’
viz. tries to discover in what direction the wind is blowing. This
clause is a variation of the theme, mplor. ventos.

l. 516. pluvias, a translation of llyazlas (which means ‘the
rainy ones ’) ; cp. 1. 402 n , and Tennysou, (bases—
‘ Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades

‘Charles’s wain ³ (originally ‘ Churl’s w.’ ‘.
