xxviii VIRGIL'S AENEm : 111.

A brief outline of the story will enable beginners to see
how each book has its place in the whole story, and will
thus add an interest which might be missed if each were
regarded as an isolated poem.

In the Fz’rst Book Virgil, like Homer, plunges in medias
res. The wrath of Heaven, especially of Juno, had kept
the exile of Troy war-wearied and storm-tossed, while he
struggled to work out his destiny and bring his gods
to Latium and found imperial Rome. Now in the seventh
year of his wanderings he is Setting sail from Sicily for the
promised land, when the undying hate of the goddess, fired
by the sear that Rome was destined to be the destruction
of her loved Carthage, rouses Aeolus, the god of the winds,
to let loose a storm upon the Trojans. Their ships are driven
on the wild Libyan coast. But Venus, mother of A‘eneas,
approaches Jupiter as a suppliant, and he discloses to her
the mighty destinies of Rome, and the golden times that
Caesar will bring. Mercury is sent to secure the friendly
reception of the Trojans by Dido, queen of Carthage. Venus
appears to her son in the garb ofa huntress and directs his way
to the city. At the banquet‚ Aeneas narrates the last death-
struggle of Troy, the treachery of Sinon, the admission os the
wooden horse within the walls, the burning of the city and
his own escape with his father, his son and the great gods
of his country. This story, the subject of the Second Book,
is taken mainly from the ‘Sack ἶφῖἶ Troy,’ by ArctinusLone
ORE} Cyclic ¹ poets.

The T lzz'rd corresponds to part of the Odyssey, and gives
Aeneas' account of the wanderings of the Trojans and their
attempts to settle in various lands.

The Fam-lh contains the passion of Dido. Inspired with
love for Aeneas, by the wiles of Venus, she was betrayed and
deserted by him, when, constrained by the orders of the gods
to fulfil his destiny, he sailed away for Italy. Maddened by
despair, the unhappy queen slew herself. The pathos and

were the greatest and are the only surviving poems. Stesichorus also
eomposed a ‘Sack of Troy,’ which some suppose Virgil to have used.
