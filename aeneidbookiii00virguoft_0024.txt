xviii VIRGIL’S AENEID : 111.

to the perfection of Virgil's shorter poems that in the magni-
ficent ode which Tennyson composed for the Mantuans in
celebration of the nineteenth centenary of Virgil's death, ἔ
while he addresses him as Poet of the Aeneid—

‘Roman Virgil, thou that singest Ilion's lofty temples robed in fire,
Ilion falling, Rome arising‚ wass, and filial saith, and DIdoffs pyre‚'

and devotes two exquisite stanzas to the Georgics—

‘ Landscape-lover, lord of language more than he that sang the
⁴ Vt'orks and Days‚'

All the chosen coin offancy flashing out from many a golden phrase;

Thou that singest wheat and woodland, tilth and vineyard‚ hive and

horse and herd,
All the 'charm of all the Muses osten flowering in a lonely word‚'

he assigns a stanza to the first and sixth Eclogues and one to
the fourth¹-—an honour paid to no individual book of the

¹ ‘ Chanter of the Pollio, glorying in the blissful years again to be,
Summers of the snakeless meadow, unlaborious earth and

oarless sea.'

The subject of this pastoral, the return of the golden age on the
expected birth of an infant, and the strange similarity of its language
to Old Testament prophecies, gave rise to the impression that
Virgil was almost a Christian, a feeling strengthened by the pure and
religious spirit which breathes through his works. Pope made this
the model of his fllessz'alz. Even in the 15th century there was
sung at Mantua in the Mass of St, Paul the verse :-—-

‘Ad Maronis mausoleum
Ductus, fudit super eum

Piae rorem lacrimae:
“Quem te‚'' inquit, “reddidissem,
Si te vivum invenissem,
Poetarum maxime. '²‘

which has been rendered :—

‘W’hen to Virgil’s tomb they brought him,
Tender love and pity wrought him

To beclew the stone with tears:
“What a saint I should have crowned thee,
Had I only living found thee
Poet first and without peers.'’'

In a miraele play os the 11tl1 century virgil and the. Sibyl are
both introduced as prophets.
