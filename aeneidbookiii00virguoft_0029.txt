of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man!
And yet how different is the Virgilian from the Home-ric
hexameter! If this be ‘imitation‚' it surely must be decmed
a more difficult seat than to have written in the old native
Saturnian metre. Then again, it was a duty X'irgil felt he
owed to Latin Literature to reproduce the structure, the
characters, the expressions, almost the very words, of his great
model. When we reflect how cramping this process must
have proved to a poet, it must excite profound admiration, not
only that the transference was made with such skill, but that
his originality survived such restrictions.

In another way, too, virgil strffers from the inevitable com-
parison with Homer. Poets may be roughly divided into two
classes—the natural and the artificial. In the one, art seems
spontaneous, and that assemblage of indefinable powers that
we call genius predominates ; in the other the art is elaborate,
and learning and talent dispute the supremacy with genius.
Virgil is preeminently a poet os the latter class, and as such
is at an unavoidable disadvantage when contrasted with one
who is the great example of native genius, in that he makes
farlarger demands on the reader. We surrender to the sway
osa Homer, and are carried along by the power of his genius.
scarcely conscious of his art, except in its effects - the delight
and admiration it inspires: to read Virgil as we ought, we
have to go through a process somewhat similar to his own

elaborate refining of thought and language, before we can
appreciate the exquisite results of his skill and unceasing

care. Nay¹ more, the study of a great natural poet sor a time
positively unfits us for the true enjoyment osone belonging to
the class we have called artificial. Who, after being imbue-d
with the inspiration of Wordsworth, can at once turn and
duly value the studied elegance of Pope? The Comparlson
is unjust‚ for the poems are different in kind. The re-
semblance—the conscious reproduction— is all in external
features. ‘But when we look for internal resemblance, the
contrastis what strikes us ¹.’ It is from a similar thought that
Nettleship writes: ‘The Aeneia’ is a poem of which the
