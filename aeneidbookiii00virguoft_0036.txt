xxx vmfflL's AENEID ε 111.

the idyllic scenes depicted on the shield of Achilles, Vulcan
had embossed on the shield of Aeneas ‘res Italas Roman-
orumque trz'mnphos,’ Romulus and the Kings of old, Manlius
and the Gauls, Catiline in torture and Cato in honour. In
the centre was the battle of Actium, and the great gods
ranged with Caesar against the false gods of Egypt and
the East ¹. The absence of Aeneas left the Trojan camp
exposed to fierce assauh, and in the Nz‘m‘lz Book we are
told how the Trojan ships are saved from the fires of
Turnus by being changed into sea—nymphs. Then comes
the beautiful story of the scouts Nisus and Euryalus, who
go forth by night from the camp to seek Aeneas and tell
him of their danger. This is modelled on the night ex-
pedition of Ulysses and Diomede in Iliad x., but the pathos

and tenderness at the close are all Virgil's own. Here too
the young Iulus (or Ascanius) first draws a bow in war, and

Apollo blesses him in the memorable words ²: ‘Macte nova
virtute, puer : sic itur ad astra.’ But Turnus, forcing his way
into the camp, was causing great slaughter when numbers
mass against him, and he escapes to his followers by plung-
ing into the yellow Tiber.

The Tentlz opens with a council of the gods, and
Jupiter allays the strife between Venus and Juno, stating
that he will be impartial: ‘Fata viam invenient) Mean-
while, Aeneas has secured the aid of Tarchon, the Etruscan
chief, and with allies drawn from as far north as Mantua
hurries in thirty ships to help his hard—pressed comrades.
He is met and sped on his way by the nymphs into
whom his own ships had been changed. Then follows
a series of battle-pieces, that afford a striking contrast'to the
fights of Homer, which breathe the stern joy a warrior feels.
Virgil’s heart is not in his story of carnage. Pallas, the brave
and noble son of Evander, after many deeds of valour is slain
by Turnus. Aeneas cuts his way through the foe seeking to
avenge him, and refuses quarter: ‘belli commercia Turnus

¹ This is a striking instance of how Virgil wove Roman ideas on
a Greek framework.
