l. 37. ‘ But when 1 essay a third clump os spent-shafts with a still
greater effert, and struggle with my knees against the resisting sand.’

l. 39. lacrimabilis: probably ‘ a weeping groan '; the term -l11'lis
having an active sense; cp. ‘ incredibilis' (Plaut. ⁴ unbelieving '), ‘ pene-
trabile frigus’ (Virg. G. i. 93.), ‘ illacrimabilem Plutona ' (Hor).

l. 40. reddita, ‘ an answering voice ‘ ; re· has a retrospect to the
investigations of Aeneas; cp. l. 717 n.

l. 43. externum: a reference to pias, ‘no alien am Ι to you,

feeling, have enabled them (viz. Virgil’s lines) to serve many minds
in many ages as a symbol of some swelling thought or overmastering
emotion, the force and meaning of which they could scarcely detine

words in which Savonarola describes the impulse which forced him

l. 45. hic . . . texit, ‘here was 1 pierced and covered beneath an
iron crop of spears that has shot up in sharp javelins.‘

p 'I'urzi vero marks the climax. The drops of blood fill Aeneas
with curiosity: it is not until he hears the warning voice that the

mixed with doubt what to do, what course to take, whether or not
to obey the waming voice :md give up the undertaking and leave the
country.
