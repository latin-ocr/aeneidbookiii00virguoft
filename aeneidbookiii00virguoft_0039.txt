INTRODUCTION. xxxiii

conscious of the harmonicus impressions resulting from
varied cadences (though we have not yet analysed how
they are produced), and of delicate beauties of thought
and expression, that are so perfect we can scarcely believe
thern intentional-the work of art. 'I'hey seem rather
felicities. But then they occur too frequently to be the work
of chance. We can trace the growth of some of them. The
conviction steals upon us that they are the result of 16116611011,
guided by unerring literary taste and inspired by a poet's
genius that defies analysis. I'assage after passage reveals
a majestic flow of music, and we see in lines, in phrases,
and 111 words more than we could have believed possible.
But the music is not all of the poetry: let us try to realize
some other 61611161115 01 Virgil's magic.

In reading through this book we are struck by the easy
and dignified course of the narrative. There are no awk-
ward breaks, 110 511611 repetitions as might readily occur
if an inferior artist were recounting a long voyage with
various attempts to found cities. The scenes are vix-idly
brought before us in a few breathing words. What pic-
tur-esqueness in description, what pathos and tenderness
and human feeling arrest our attention! Then, again,
if we put ourselves in the place of a Roman—one of the
imperial race, to whom his patriotism was his religion, who
had ever before his imagination the tiny commencements
which grew by painful effort in the face of dangers that
seemed at times overwhelming into that mighty fabric of
empire—we can in some degree realize the burst of enthusiasm
which greeted the poem, whose predominant note is this 111-
spiring thought, whose ‘ocean-roll of rhythm sounds for ever
of Imperial Rome.‘ We can feel for a moment that the fate
of Rome is being carried in the frail barks of Aeneas over a
stormy sea ¹.
