NOTES. 47

The reading of almost all the best Mss, concita, ‘the seas di<-
turbed by many an isle‚’ would seem to bc out ‹rsplace in a description

⁸1. 128. nauticus . . clamor ε perhaps the celeusma (‘ command ') os
the steersmen (Con.); cp. v. 140 n.‚ but inore probably ‘a cheer.'
Ribbeck would place ll. 12S—9 after l. 123, but Virgil ‘ according to
his usual manner gratifics the impatienee and curiosity of his hearers
first, aud, this done, returns and particularizcs at leisure ' (Henry).

vario, ‘ in varied rivalry 'z shouts of rivalry srom all sides.

l. 129. petamus, ‘ each encourages his comrades, “ For Crete and
our forefathers‚ ho!'” (Con.)

1. 130. prosequitur, ‘escorts'3 cp. vi. 897. The lineis from Hom.
Od. xi. 7, where ἐσθλὸν ἑταῖρον, ‘kind companion‚’ suggests
prosequitur.

1, 131. Curetum: cp. l. 113 η.

1. 132. optatae, ‘the longed—f0r‚ sated city' (Henry‘, not ‘the
city chosen with auspices' (Con.); cp. i. 172; iii. 509.

l. 133. Pergameam‚ ‘I call (the city) Pergaina.' stangnum-am
being an adj. with urbem understood, perhaps the modern l’latania.

cognomine, ‘rcjoicing in the name corresponding' to the old
name of the citadel of '1 roy (viz. Pergama). Such is the force of
cognomzue.

l. ¹3⁴- amare focos, ‘to cling to their domestic hearths‚' ‘1 bid
them love hearth and home' (Com). For the infin„ which is

‘ galeasque attollere conis,’ ‘to increase the height os helmets by the
addition of cones' <Henry> ; ii. 185.

l. 135. fere: this word has been suspected, but it seems to go
with the whole scene ‘ now the colony was well-nigh founded —our
ships drawn up, &c.’ Or perhaps it qualifies ιἀυιᾳτιε,ί about now

(fontibjl's) here, but the analogy of prondbus. t'muflms would suggest
the possibility 01 the vowel being shortened in thesis ,viz in the
unaccented part of the soot), as the synizesis is very ugly. In the
arsis (accented part os the sootx the vowel is. of course. long; cp. iv.

therefore I cannot come.'

operata t sc. crat, ‘ was engaged in.’
