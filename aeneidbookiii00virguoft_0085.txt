Asia's power, and the guiltless race of l'riam.’ res, ‘power‚' cp.
Aen. viii. 471 ‘res Troiae.' It is, of course, an exaggeration to speak
of Priam as ruling Asia, even in its Roman sense, viz. the coast os
Asia Minor. His kingdom was confined to the environs of Troy.

l. 2. visum, se. est, ‘seemed good ’ς cp. ii. 428 ‘dis aliter visum?

l. 3. ‘After that the lordly Ilium had fallen and Troy reared by

diversas in terras traherentur.’]

It may be noticed that deserta must be supplied with exsilia, and
diversas with lerras. This brevity os expression (viz. brachylogy)
is a feature os Horace's style.
