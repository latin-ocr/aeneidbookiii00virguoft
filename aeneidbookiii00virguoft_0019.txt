perhaps again repaired to R‘ome to complain that <lue process
os law was ineffectual against lawless violence. Maecenas,
who had already on the strength of a slight acquaintance
moved in his behalf, had now had time to recognize his merit
in the Bucolz'cs, and cut the knot os the difficulty by giving
him an estate in the south os Italy.

‘Iugera perdiderat miserae vicina Cremonae
Flebat et abductas Tityrus aeger oves.

Risit Tuscus eques, paupertatemque malignam
Reppulit et celeri iussit abire suga.

“Accipe divitias et vatum maximus estom—

says Martial (Ep. viii. 56), writing at the end of the
first century. lt is possible that the death os Virgil's father
(who we are told had become blind) at this time may have
made him more resigned to leaving sor ever his Mantuan
home, which had now become a scene os turbulenee.

The Bucolics (or Eclogues) can in the main be placed
between 41 and 37 ηρ, though virgil, in accordance with his
habit of composition, may have revised and altered them
subsequently, and have had portions of them written earlier
and made known to literary friends. We are told that he
had long contemplated an epic poern on res Romanas or
gesta Regum Albanorum, but, as he says Buc. vi. 3,

‘Cum canerem reges et proelia Cynthius aurem
Vellit et a‹lmonuit,’

that he should compose bucolic poetry aster the manner of
Theocritus. Now Maecenas again diverted his attention
from epic poetry by setting him to write the (1‘e·022grt'cs'.
These wer‘e commenced in 37 B.C.‚ not long after the dipro-
matic journey to Brundisium which Maecenas took. in view
of Octavian's ill-success against Sext. I’ompey, to endeavour
to reconcile Antony‚ and os which Horace has given an inten-
tionally guarded account. It is interesting to note that

too how exquisitely the love os father and son is depicta-«l in the
parting os Evander aud l'allas (Ac-n. viii. 568 584'. laven the licite
Mezentius, contemplor divom, gives evidence os a father's s1 elings
(Aen. x. adfin.). The last linc reads like a sarowell to Mantua
