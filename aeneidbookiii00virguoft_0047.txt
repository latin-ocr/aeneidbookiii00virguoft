swoons—‘ calor ossa reliquit) Then her first thought when
waking to consciousness is, if Aeneas could return from
the dead, why not Hector?

‘ Aut, si lux alma recessit,
Hector ubi est 3 '

The spark of hopeless hope has not been quite quenched by
her long sorrow. Look again how much loving pride is ex-
pressed by the two words of Aeneas—⁶ Hectoris Andromache?
Further on we notice one of those ‘pathetic half-lines,’ the
only one that leaves the sense unfinished. Itis where she
should speak of the lost Creusa, but to us the pathos is
deepened by the thought that the master's hand was cold
ere he could mould to beauty the tender thought that was in
his mind when working at this scene. XVhen she notices
Ascanius, it serves only to evoke another phase of hei· undying
meinory of Hector : ἡ

‘ Ecquid in antiquam virtutem animosque viriles
Et pater Aeneas et avunculus excitat Hector¹ ζ’

And we mark how here, as elsewhere, Virgil links his hero
with the great hero of Troy. But when Andromache had had
time to know Ascanius and to see in him a likeness to her
own lost son Astyanax, what grace and tenderness breathe in
her parting words (486 sqq.)—

‘Accipe et haec, manuum tibi quae monimenta nicarum
Sint, puer, et longum Andromachae testentur amorem,
Coniugis Hectoreae. Cape dona extrema tuorum,

O mihi sola mei super Astyanactis imago ’“’.’

Even the fierce monster Polyphemus is not left without

¹ ¹ Feels he the hereditary ssame,

His growing spirit fire
At Hector's and Aeneas' name,
His uncle aud his sire3’

‘Nay, tal-:e these too, and let them prove
A fond memorial os the love

Os Hector’s sometime wife,
Dear child of Troy, in whom alone
Astyanax, my lost, my own,

Survives in second life! '
