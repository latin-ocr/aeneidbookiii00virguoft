xii VIRGIL'S ΑΕΝΕΙῙ) : 111.

student of Virgil‚ attending the lectures of the Epicurean
philosopher Siron, and, being a literary man himself, valued
the poet's appreciation‚ and doubtless gave him grounds for
extravagant hopes. virgil, probably forgetting how little
‘carmina valent tela inter Martiass over—estimated the effect
of the young general Octavian's decree and the influence of
the legate. Varus, we find, was afterwards accused by
Cornelius Gallus of leaving the Mantuans only the marshy
portion of their lands, and Virgil was involved in quarrels
(‘Si rixa est ubi tu pulsas ego vapulo tantum ⁵) with Iawless
soldiers ‘about boundaries,⁷ and saved his life by swimming
the Mincius or hiding in a charcoal-burner’s hut from an
Arrius, a Claudius, or a Milienus Toro. His complaint is
pathetically uttered in Bucolic ix. He was forced to seek
shelter in a villa that belonged to his old master Siron ¹, and

before Bac. i.‚ which expresses gratitude sor redress, and so denies
that there was a double ejectment. The great difficulty in this theory
is that it would assume that Pollio retained influenee aster his super-
session by Varus. Pollio helped Virgil, and yet Varus is mentioned
in Buc. ix. It seems to me more reasonable to doubt a double
restitution. &Vhen the soldiers were overflowing the country from
Cremona, Mantua, though nearly forty miles distant, was still
nimium vicina Cremonae, and so in danger, and Virgil appealed
sor help for his father and neighbourS. He was no doubt elated at
his success, and exaggerated its effect. Then carne the levy of money
on those whose lands were spared. This and jealousy at the unfair
partition of the Mantuan lands would cause violence. The poet‘s
life was endangered and he fied. Why should we suppose that he
ever returned? His friends more than indemnified him sor his loss.
The Gemgics were composed in Southern Italy. As sar as the
Lives tell us, the ⁴ smooth-sliding Mincius crowned with vocal reeds '
knew him no more.
¹ Catalecta viii. (x.)—

‘ Villula quae Sironis eras, et pauper agelle,
Verum illi domino tu quoque divitiae,

Me tibi et hos una mecum, quos semper amavi,
Si quid de patria tristius audiero,

Commendo in primisque patrem: tu nunc eris illi
Mantua quod fuerat quodque Cremona prius.'

In the words in primisque patrem we may see a touch of the filial
gratitude which Horace so beautifully expressed (Sat. i. 6. 70—100)‚
and which adds deep feeling to the sympathetic portrayal of the
pictas of Aeneas towards Anchises (Aen. iii. 480, and 708-712). See
