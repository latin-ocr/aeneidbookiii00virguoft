xxxvi V1RG1L's AENEm : 111.

And we cannot but recall the actual words of the Sibyl
(Aen. vi. 83 sqq.) :—

‘O tandem magnis pelagi defuncte periclis——

Sed terrae graviora manent—in regna Lavini

Dardanidae venient; mitte hane de pectore euram;

Sed non et venisse volent. Bella, horrida bella,

Et Thybrim multo spumantem sanguine cerno ¹.’

Everywhere throughout the poem are the stern old Roman
virtues inculcated and glorified. Courage in the face of
danger, stubborn patience and unflinching resolution (cf.
Horace’s ‘iustum et tenacem propositi virum ') are ever in
the thought of ‘Roman Virgi12' εᾖ

‘Sic fortis Etruria crevit
Scilicet et rerum sacta est pulcherrima Roma?
‘Disce puer virtutem ex me verumque laborem.¹

‘Quidquid erit, superanda omnis fortuna ferendo est?

Notice too how it is never forgotten that Aeneas is the Man
of Destiny‚ always under the guidance of Heavenly Powers :
In 363,

‘Cuncti suaserunt mimine divi
Italiam petere ’ :

and Helenus recognizes the divine authority (375),

‘Sic fata deum rex
Sortitur volvitque vices, is vertitur ordo.'

 

Eaeh cloud that darkens on your sky
Her lips shall tell, and with success
The temnant of your journey bless.‘

‘O freed at length from toils by sea!

But worse on land remain.
The warrior sons of Dardany

Lavinium's realms shall gain;
That sear dismiss: but fortune cross
Shall make them wish their gain were loss.
WVar, dreadful war, and Tiber flood
I see inearnadined with blood?

² The exquisite propriety of the words with which Tennyson
begins his poem loses nothing is we remember that he perhaps had
in his mind the words of Petronius (Sat. 1 18) ‘Romanusque Vergilius
et Horati curiosa felicitas? The passages, the first occurring to the
mind, come froin G. ii. 533, Aen. xii 435, and Aen. v. 710.
