xl VIRGIL‘S AENEID: 111.

of the Cyclops standing on the shore with baffled rage in the
eye of each has much picturesque power (678 sqq.) 1-—

‘Aetnaeos fratres, eaelo capita alta ferenteS‚
Concilium horrendum: quales cum vertice celso
Ae'riae quercus aut coniferae cyparissi
Constiterunt, silva alta Iovis lucusve Dianae ¹.’

But such vivid pictures are innumerable and they lose by
being severed from the context.

ΙΙΙ. The tender pathos of Virgil need not here be illus-
trated at much length ; for it is a quality which cannot be denied
by the most prejudiced detractor, and it is to other parts of
the poem that one would naturally turn for instances. Such
for example would be the great episode of Dido in Book iv,
of which &Valter Savage Landor says: ‘Admirably as two
Greek poets have represented the tenderness, the anguish,
the terrific wrath and vengeance of Medea, all the works they
ever wrote contain not the poetry which Virgil has condensed
into about a hundred verses: omitting, as we must, those
which drop like icicles from the rigid lips of Aeneas! But
even in this Book the ear will catch the tone of him whom
Tennyson addresses as ‘Thou majestis: in thy sadness at the
doubtful doom of human kind? The pathos of line 140—

‘Linquebant dulces animas aut aegra trahebant
Corpora,'

is not affected by our recollecting that it 15 an echo from
Lucretius (v. 989). Turn then to the beautiful scene (306 sqq),
where Aeneas comes upon Andromache offering memorial
sacrifice at the cenotaph of Hector. At first in terror at his
appearance, as if he were a visitant from the dead, she

‘ There glaring fierce we see them stand
In idle rage, a hideous band,

The sons of Aetna, carrying high
Their towering summits to the sky:
So on a height stand clustering trees,
Tall oaks or cone-elad cypresses‚

The stately forestry of Jove,

Or Dian's venerable grove.'
