INTRODUCTION. xix

Aeneia’ except the sixth, th'e prosound thought and sublime
imagination of which would especially appeal to the author
of In Alemoriam—

‘Thou that see'st universal nature moved by universal mind:
Thou majestic in thy sadness at the doubtful doom os human kind)

It was the majesty of this great vision in the sixth book that
inspired another poet, Dante, and caused him to choose
Virgil as his guide in 'the Inferna.

There are but few more facts that can help us in picturing
to our imaginations the man, who by the power os his youth-
ful song won the admiration and sriendship os statesmen and
victorious generals, and the applause of Roman crowds ¹. ln
person he was tall and dark-complexioned, shy and reserved
in manner, somewhat awkward and untidy, with an air os
‘ rusticity 2 ’ clinging to him. He seldom visited the house on
the Esquiline hill which Maecenas had given him, preferring
the retirement of Naples, not only to escape public admira-
tion which he found embarrassing, but sor the sake os his
health‚ for he seems to have suffered from constant delicacy,
and to have been dyspeptic and perhaps consumptive ³².
His character must have been very lovable and sincere, is in
some cases ⁴ showing a want of robustness and independence

¹ Tacitus, Dial. xiii, tells how the audience at a theatre, where one
os the Eclogues was being sung, rose to applaud virgil as is he were
the em eror.

² Topthis Horace (Sat. i. 3. 33) is supposed to allude :—

‘At ingenium ingens
Inculto latet hoc sub corpore?

³ The fact that both his brothers Silo and Flaccus died young
seems to point to hereditary disease. This would lend probability
to the supposition that Virgil's father was dead about 39 Β. c., and
that this rendered Virgil less reluctant to leave his Mantuan home.
His mother married a second time, and we are told died soon aster
Flaccus. If Flaccus is celebrated as Daphnis in Bur. v., as Servius
states, this would settle the question. His half-brother, by his inother's
second marriage, V. Proculus, inlierited hals his estate. As no
guardian is mentioned, we may reasonably suppose l‘roculus to have
been nineteen years os age at the time os Virgil's death.

¹ For example, the suppression of the tribute to Gallus which is
said to have formed the conclusion os Gcoaegr’c iv., at the bidding of
the Emperor.
