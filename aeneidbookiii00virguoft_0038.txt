from a bearn in the palace roof. At this dread news Turnus
determines to face Aeneas and meet his doom1: ‘Usque
adeone mori miserum est?' He will go down to the grave
unstained. Springing from the charior, he rushes through
the hosts as an avalanche. Aeneas turns from setting fire
to the city and meets him, towering mighty as a snow-capped
mountain. The sword of Turnus is shivered on the ›heaven—
wrought armour, and the spear of Aeneas is fixed fast in a
wild olive stock. But Juturna restores to her brother his
father's sword, and Venus plucks forth the spear. Then the
Olympian king bade Juno cease. She obeys, begging only
that the Latius change not their name or language. A Fury
sent from the pitin the form of an ill-omened bird terrifies
Turnus, and the spear of Aeneas brings him to his knee.
Even now his life might have been spared. His appeal to
Aeneas to pity the age of his father Daunus, and restore him
to him alive or dead is touching the heart of the victor. But
as he hesitates his eye caught sight of the gold-studded
sword-belt which Turnus had reft from the body of the slain
Pallas. Wrathful sorrow burst into flame; and exclaiming‚
⁴ 1t is Pallas that strikes this blow, Pallas that exacts this
vengeance,' he buried his sword in his breast, His limbs ·
relax in death, and his spirit wailing for lost youth passed
down to the Shades below.

III. SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF VIRGIL.

It is only when we have mastered the general sense and
the scansion of the hexameter (for the stately melody of the
verse can be appreciated only by a trained ear) that we can be
said to read the text—to read Virgil. Then reading correctly,
according to the sense passing through our minds—-and
gradually the distance between the words read and the
sense becomes shorter, till eventually there is no appreciable
break—we begin to feel a pleasing rhythmical effect, and we
become gradually aware of the exquisite adaptation of words
to meaning, of sound to sense. Then we grow more and more
