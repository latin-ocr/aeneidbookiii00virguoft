Italian, and the arrangement and handling wholly Greek¹.’
The conception that Rome was the special care of the gods—
that a mighty destiny guided every step of the Trojan exiles
and protected them through dangers, till they should found
the city, which was after centuries of struggle to be the
Queen of the World, that the glories of the Roman race
should culminate in the Caesars whose origin was divine,—
is thoroughly Roman. Aeneas, great warrior though he is, is
still more the civilizing hero, of whom Homer afforded no
example. The Homeric heroes destroy cities: he founds
them. His constant epithet is pius, just as it is only to his
chief soe Turnus that the term violens is applied. ‘Hic
psetatz's honos?’ exclaims Venus in her appeal to Jupiter.
And he unrolls for her the secrets of Fate:

‘Bellum ingens geret Italia, populosque feroces
Contundet, moresque viris et moenia ponet.

Even Juno will relent z

Again in Book xii„ when Aeneas makes the treaty with
Latinus, he chooses for his part the civil and religious
functions:

‘Sacra deosque dabo: socer arma Latinus habet0³.'

Thus religion, as understood by the Romans-saith in

whole poem.

The management of the legend of Aeneas is also distinc-

ing homes as they wandered westward after the sack of
Troy. Thus Diomede settled at Arpi, in what was later
Alagma Graecia, as we see in Aen. xi.; and Antenor, a
