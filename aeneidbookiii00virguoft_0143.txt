Ost as he changes his weary side, great Sicily’s srame

Trembles with thunders enslirouding the heavens in smoke
of hei· fite,

All night long till morning we bore these prodigies dire,

Hid in the forest nor saw we the cause of the uproar there.

Starlight none was beaming, no bright and radiant air

Shone from the constellations, the sky was with darkness

strewn ·
Dead and ’unbroken night in a storin-cloud prisoned the
moon.
