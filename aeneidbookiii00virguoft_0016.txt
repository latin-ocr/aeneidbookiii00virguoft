x VIRG1L's AENEID: 111.

in the first consulship of Pompey and Crassus. His father,
a potter according to one account, or, as others say, a thrifty
retainer of 0116 Magius, who married his master's daughter ¹,
acquired some property, and, like Horace’s father, was able
to give his son a good education. Virgil was attending
school at Cremona when he assumed the loga virilis on his
fifteenth birthday‚ when Pompey and Crassus were consuls
for the second time, 55 B.C.‚ and, tradition adds, on the very
day on which Lucretius died at the age of forty-four years.
He was then sent to Mediolanum (Milan), and when about
eighteen years old to Rome, where for some years he studied
Greek and Latin literature, rhetoric and philosophy under
the best masters. During this period he formed warm
friendships with men who afterwards became famous, amongst
whom were Asinius Pollio2 (subsequently legate of Cisalpine
Gaul), Alfenus Varus³ (who succeeded Pollio in 41 B.C.),
probably Octavius (grand-nephew of the great Julius, who
when adopted by him became C. Julius Caesar Octavianus,
and, in 27 B.C., Augustus), M. Plotius Tucca, L. Varius4 the
epic poet, Horace, and Maecenas, the great patron of letters.
He was probably intended to become a lawyer, but finding
himself unfitted for that profession, whether from feebleness
of health or slowness of speech, he pleaded only one case,
and devoted himselfto the more congenial studies ofliterature
and philosophy ⁵. He returned to the country at some time

¹ His mother's name Mzgz'a may have contributed to the super-
stitious associated with Virgil in the middle ages, The soa-les
[f'engrilz'anae are often mentioned by old historians. The story that
Charles Ι consulted the Bodleian Library virgil and read his (100111
111 Aen. iv. 615 sqq. is well known.

² See Bucolics iv. and viii.

³ Not to be confused with Quintilius Varus, who was also a native
of Cremona and a friend of Virgil and of Horace tsee Hor. C. i. 18
and 24). For Alfenus Varus see 011 linc. vi. and ix. 27.

⁴ Tucca and Varius (Bm. ix. 35) were appointed by Augustus to
edit the Aeneid after Virgil's death. It is interesting to lind them
along with Virgil joining Horace and Maecenas on the journey to
Brundisium (Hor. S. i. 5. 40 &c., cs. ib. i. 10. 81, where they are again
mentioned together). Sec also Hor. C. i. 6. 1.
