INTRODUCTION. xxix

power of this book owe somewhat to Greek tragedy, and
Virgil borrowed some touches from the picture of Medea in the
Argonaulics of Apollonius Rhodius; but the intense feeling
with which the struggle between duty and passion is depicted
in the emotions of the chief actors is an undying evidence
of the tragic genius of the poet.

In the Fifllz Book Aeneas is again brought to Sicily, to the
tomb of his father Anchises, where he celebrates memorial
games. This episode, which follows closely the games in
Iliad xxiii.‚ given by Achilles at the funeral of Patroclus,
is perhaps the least successful in the Aenesd. Perhaps,
τοο, its weakness is accentuated by its having been thrust
in where, as the various inconsistencies show, it had never
been intended to be placed— between the tragic splendour
of the Fourtlz and the sublimity and mysterious grandeur of
the Sixtlz. In this latter Aeneas lands at Cumae, and,
guided by the prophetess, the Sibyl, descends to the Under-
world and meets the shade of AnchiseS, who foretells to his
son the glories of his descendants.

The Seventla brings the exiles to the Tiber‚ where a treaty is
made with Latinus, the King of Laurentum, who offers his
daughter Lavinia in marriage to the Trojan leader. But
the wrath of Juno stirs up Turnus, king of the Rutuli,
who had been one of the suitors of Lavinia, to break the
truce. The same messenger of discord, the Fury Allecto
sent from Hades, strikes with frenzy Amata the Latin queen.
The first blood is shed3 and we have the muster-roll of the
Italiam, on which Virgil dwells with patriotic enthusiasm.

ln the Ezgrlztle Aeneas goes to seek the aid of Evander,
the Arcadian king of Pallanteum, which was on the site
where Rome was destined to arise. He was keeping the
feast of Hercules and recounts the story of his victory over
Cacus‚-—an instance of the triumph os civilization over
barbarism, that may be taken as an augury of the future.
By his advice Aeneas appeals to the Etruscans to join
him against their cruel king Mezentius, who had espoused
the cause of Turnus. As in Iliad xviii„ the mother of the
hero brings him heaven-wrought armour: but instead of
