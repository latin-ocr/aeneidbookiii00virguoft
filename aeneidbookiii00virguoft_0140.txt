90 VIRGIL’s AENEID: 111.

191-208.

We hoist our sails, and pent in hollow oak,

Scud o‘er the vasty deep. And now our ships
Had gained the open main, nor aught was seen
Save sky and sea the wide horizon round;
XVhen, big with night and storm‚ a livid cloud
Dark lowering drew above our heads, and all
The ruffled deep gave back the scowl of heaven.
Anon the winds in long continuous swell ’
Uplift the waves, and, stirred from lowest depths,
Old Ocean heaves and rises in his might.
Scattered diverse, we rove the watery waste,

Mist chokes the day and humid night the sky.
While forky lightnings cleave with frequent flash
The riven clouds. Flung from our course, we roam
The pathless waters blind, while day from night
E'en Palinure doth own his skill at fault

To read aright from out the murky sky,

Or gather up again his reckoning lost.

Three twilight days with blinding sog obscured
We drift the deep, and three long starless nights;
The fourth at last, up-peering from the wave,
Land shows ahead, and now at nearer view
Gives far-off hills to sight and curling sumke:
Down drop the sails, and, taking to the oars,
NVe toss the spray and sweep the foaming flood.

It chanced Andromache that day
There in a grove without the wall
Beside a milnic Simois wave
VVas making funeral festival
At Hector’s counterfeited grave,
Raised by her hands, a grassy heap,
With altars twain, whereat to weep.
XVhen as she saw my near advance
And marked our Trojan cognimnce,
Awhile distracted and amazed
She stood, and stiffened as she gazed:
Her life-blood leaves her cheeks:
She saints: at last from earth upraised
In faltering tones she speaks:
