glimpses of the heavens through the seudding drifts.

l. 569. Cyclopum oris, ‘ the safe and spacious harbour ' was called

Catana. The Homerie ‘land os the Cyclops’ was near Drepanum
(Trapanil, on the west coast of Sicily.

adlabimur: the pres. after the perf. reliquit (lraws attention to
the gentle motion of the vessels alter the lull of the wind.

l. 570. ab accessu ventorum, ‘unruffled (and secure) from the
approach of the winds.’ The use of the prep. may be (lue to a desire
to remind the reader of the more usual phrase remotus a ventis.
These lines are suggested by Hom. Od. ix. 136, ‘ There is a fair haven,
where is no need of moorings, either to cast anchor or to fasten
hawsers, but men may run the ship on the beaeh, and tar ry until such
time as the sailors are minded to be gone and favourable breezes blow.'

l. 571. ipse, ‘ although spacious in itsels, the harbour is deserted
on account of the proximity of the volean0.'

ruinis, ‘awful eruptions‚' from sno, ‘to heap up'3 ep. Lucr. vi. 726

means ‘ downfall' (ep i. 129 ‘caelique ruina’; Tennyson, Lucretius,
‘ Ruining along the illimitable inane ’>, as ruo generally means ‘to
level' (cp. G. i. 105 ‘cumulosque ruit male pinguis harenae'). Virgil
deserts Hom. in speaking of Aetna as a volcano. The earliest re-
corded eruption occurred in 479 Rc„ and was described by Pind.
P. i. 20 seqq, ‘whereout pure springs of unapproaehable fire are
vomited from the inmost depths: in the daytinie the lava-streams
pour forth a lurid rush of smoke; but in the darkness a red rolling
flame sweeps the rocks with uproar to the wide sea' (My-ers, and
Aeseh. Prorn. V. 367 seqq, Virgil is indebted to these passages,
and also to Lucr. vi 680 seqq„ and to his own earlier work, G. ii.
308 seqq. we may further compare Milton, P. L. i. 230 seqq.—
