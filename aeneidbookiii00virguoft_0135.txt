at times: e. g. Aeneas leaves Carthage in the teeth osa North wind
(cp. v. 1 seqq). Some editors think that dare lintea retro means ‘to
retrace our former course ' to Tarentum (viz. by steering NAEj¹ , but it
seems impossible to believe that retro does not mean the opposite
os the course along which they were borne by the south wind.
Mr. Page translates, ‘On the other hand stands in warning the
command os Helenus “ Between S. and Ch. the path on either hand
is within a hair's breadth of death, is ye snil to hold your course '':
’tis resolved therefore‚‘ &c. Styllam . . . cursus being in oblique narra-
tion. This rendering explains πί teneant (zui tenetis of direct
speechl, where m' teneamus would be expected, but the omission
os esse in l. 685 is strange, and Helenus’s warning was to avoid the
strait altogether, not to steer exactly through the middle of the
passage.

l. 683. excutere: cp. l. 2⁶7 n. The infin. (sor ut with subj.) is
notieeable; cp. i. 11 ‘tot adire lab: res Ι impulerit.'

l. 684. eontra: Madvig's ern. contra ac has been accepted by
many editors. Is it is right, the colon must be removed aster
cursus (l. 6865 ‘contrary to the comm-ands of Helenus, our purpose
is to sail baek' (towards Pelorus). But this needless alteration
destroys the effect of the dramatic ecre (l. 687).

l. 685. utramque viam : in apposition to cursus (1.686). For the
end os the line cp. ix. 143 ‘ leti discrimina parva'; x. 511. The abl. is
descriptive. The original os this line, Apoll. R. iv. 831 ⁸ Butsteer
thou the ship thither, where there shall be a hair-breadth escape
from destruction,' shows that lete· must be taken with discrimine,
not with viam as Nettleship thinks.

l. 686. ni: old Latin sor ne; cp. Lucret. ii. 734, and i. 277,
where Donatus alludes to this passage to explain nimirum.

teneant: the subject is indes. and so the phrase is equivalent to
‘that the course should not be steeretl ’ς cp. l. 106 n.

l. 688. missus: sc. by the gods.

vivo, ‘ natural rock.’

l. 689. Pantagiae: the modern Porcari, ‘which flows through
a deep ravine between caleareous rocks, affording a small but secure
harbour for small vessels ' (Papillon). At its mouth lay Trotilon,
one of the earliest Greek settlements in Sicily.

Megaros : a strange adj. formed from Alegarm cp. Ithacus srorn
Ithaca. llyblaean Alegara was on the Gulf of Megara &now Cotto
di Augusta), a dozen miles north os Syracuse.

Thapsum: the modern Penisola Magnisi, a sandy spot, raised
but little above the sea fatentem).
l. 690. relegens . . . retrorsus: not found elsewhere in Virgil.

subsequently to his adventure in the cave os the Cyclops, and that
