care and constant elaboration. The Aenct‘d, we read, he
blocked out in prose, and then worked at the various books
in no definite order just as his fancy or studies led hini.
This accounts not only sor the numerous inconsistencics ¹, but
sor the sact that the poem is studded with brilliant passages„
perfect in themselves, and abounds in exquisite phrases that
haunt the memory-‘ jewels five-words long) 'she lxmam,-
(or Eclogms) are more or less ideal sketches os country lise,
in which real events and persons are mixed up incongruously
with mythological scenes and allusions. They lack the native
truth and bright sreshness of their Greek model, Theocritus.
but the artistic skill of the execution hides the unreality os
the conceptions‚ and Virgil's real love os the country makes
pictures of such beauty that we sorget the convention-
ality of the details. The Gemgits are his most finished work
and are regarded by many as his masterpiece. Professedly
based on Hesiod-a shrewd old Boeotian, who put his ‘ points
of good husbandry ' into the form of hexameters to be more
easily remembered, and called them‘ Works and Days ’—and
other didactic versifiers, it is wonderful how Virgil's imagina-
tion throws a poetic beauty over the homely details os the
good advice he gives as to the daily duties ofthe husbandman.
Apart from such magnificent passages as the descriptions os
the storm and of the glories os Italy, or touching episodes such
as the death of the ox and the story of Orpheus, no one who
has ever felt the love of the ‘divine country ’ can read any
portions of these delightsul poeins without freshened recol-
lection and pleasurable eniotion. Not to dwell on Macaulay's
characteristically exaggerated praise ², it is a striking tribute

¹ e. g. Aeneas in Book iii. knows nothing os a propheey just
delivered to him in Book ii. Book v. does not harmonize with Book
iv. and Book vi. Virgil seems to have been working at Book vii. nt
the time of his death.

² That he preferred the Georgics to the Acneid, and the Eclogucs
to the Georgics. He said that the finest lines in the Latin langunge
are the five, Buc. viii. 37-41, ‘ Sepibus in nostris '. διε. It is strange
that Voltaire subscribed to so extmvagant nn eulogy on this charm-
ing 'garden scene. A spray os apple·blossom is beautiful, but to my
it was the finest sight in the world would be not a little absurd.
