and in the answer of the god,

‘Antiquam exquirite matrem.
Hie domus Aeneae cunetis dominabitur oris,
Et nati natorum et qui nascentur ab illis ¹.’

Rome is not to be a mere colony of Troy. Italy was the
cradle of empire before Troy stood. 1t was as the gods
declarecl in the mighty vision,

‘ Terra antiqua, potens arinis atque ubere glebae‚’

ancient greatncss. They say (158—160)‚

‘ Idem venturos tollemus in astra nepotes

Imperiumque urbi (labimus. Tu moenia magnis

Magna para, longumque fugae ne linque laborem ²)
How these last words strike the keynote os Roman glory—
the indomitable endurance of the Roman character! How

‘Longa procul longis via dividit invia terris?
Even aster Aeneas reaches Italy his struggles will not be

‘Illa tibi Italiae populos venturaque bella,

Et quo quemque modo fugiasque serasque laborem,
Expediet ⁴.’

 

‘ Go, seek your ancient mother’s track.
There shall Aeneas’ house, reuewed
For ages, rule a world suhdued.’

'² Contrast the description of Rbmc's great rival [Aen. i. 12 sqq.),

‘ Salve, magna parens frugum, Saturnia tellus,
Magna virum.'

‘We, who have sailed among your crew
The swelling billows o’er,

Your seed as demi-gods will crown,
And make them an imperial town.
Btuld you the walls decreed by Fate,
And let them, like ourselves, be great,
Nor, till your task be (lone, sorbeat
The toil of flight, how long soe'er.'

The story of your wars to he,
And how to sace, or how to fly
