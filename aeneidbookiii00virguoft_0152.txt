taken from the tomb of Xanthus, are more benevolent than those
represented by virgil. The egg-shaped body is said to symbolize
return to life. The figure carried off is probably Merope.

hat, worn by one figure and slung at the back of the other. Note
also that the hatted figure wears the buskin (cothurnus), the othernot.
The chlamys is clasped by a buekle‚ and hangs lightly from the
shoulder.

p. 20. Ulysses and Scylla. This illustration, from :tn-Etruscan
cinerary urn, represents a fight between Ulysses and the fabulous
monster Scylla. During his seafarings after the sack of Troy, Ulysses
(odysseus) twice ran between the perilous Scylla and Charybdis.
Homer represents Scylla as a monster shaped in the upper part like
a dog, with six heads and neeks, and twelve feet. But another form
of the legend represents her as a maiden whose legs were turned by the
wiles of Circe into serpentine coils In the illustration Scylla is
girt with weeds instead of the usual dogs' or wolves' skins. ln her
left hand she holds a part of the broken rudder of the ship. Ulysses
and one of his companions, both clutched in the coils‚ attack her on
opposite sides, and two of his companions have already been killed.

p. 21. isv'byl. In her left hand she holds a roll—one of the
Sibylline books.

p. 23. Andromache. Note the Argive shield.

p. 25. lllz'nerva. Note the crested helmet with the visor raised.
The goddess is holding a palera instead of the usual statue os Victory‚
which shows it to be a Roman work.

p. 29. Polyphemus. This is quite a benevolent-looking monster.
111 his left hand he holds a lyre, and in his right a plectrum, the
implement sor striking its strings. He is seated on a rock covered
with the skin of some animal, a club is resting against it: a ram
typifies his original pastoral character; and apparently a Cupid is
drawing his attention to something in the distance. The dotted
line indicates what remains of the original: all outside it has been
restored.

p. 33. Aeneas. From a vase. Note the enormous crest, and
the φάλος, or sorepieee, also the corslet, shield and greaves (ocreae),
and the two spears with which he is commonly represented (see Aen.
