over the effect produced by individual woros, we may compare
thern with other pictures os the same awe-inspiring pheno-
menon. Then we realize what is meant hy the words that
Virgil is a great literary artist. l'indar (l’ytlz. i), Aeschylus
(From. Vinc.) and Lucretius (Book vi) were ειΙΙ before his
mind’s eye as he executed his own picture, with unfniling
taste culling a phrase here or a word there, modisying it by
his own experience and reflection, heightening a colom or
deepening a shade, till his work became, as it has been
called ¹, a ‘precious mosaic’ every gem of which is polished
with extreme care. Virgil has nothing to lose from such a
process of comparison. The scholar’s pleasure is heightened,
as it is when he reads Milton, by the recollection of some
parallel phrase that had scrved as a model, and by his
wondering admiration os the saultless skill which has guided
every change. Virgil even adopts and rnodifies his own earlier
work—as Shakespeare and Tennyson have so osten done,
poets whom he resembles in his power os turning to gold
what he takes sronn his memory rather than from crentive
thought. Compare with the lines quoted above from (J. i.

472, the linc (574)—

‘ Attollitque globos flammarum et sidera lambit)

The last phrase has been criticized as being exaggerated.
What then is to be said os Shakespeare (Tempesl‚ i. 2. 4)—

‘the sea, rn‹›unting*t0 the welkin'n cheek,
Dashes the sure out ’7

The marvel is not that in an impassioned passage some ex-
pressions seem strained, but that there are so few that do not
appear highly effective to those who have not the added
pleasure of knowing their source. lt was some such reflec-
