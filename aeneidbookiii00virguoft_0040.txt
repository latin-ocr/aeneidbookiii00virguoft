xxxiv VIRGIL’s AENEID ε 111.

Let us then cull some instances from the book before us
of (1) Virgil's national feeling in close union with his religious
spirit, (2) of his picturesqueness, and (3) of his tenderness.

Ι. When the exiles weeping leave the pl uns w·heie Troy
had stood, they0 cro forth to the deep, trusting to the guidance
of heaven, quo fata ferant’ (7), and with the great gods of
their race, ‘cum . . . Penatibus et magnis Dis’ (12). We
notice how scrupulously rites are observed on every important
occasion. See lines 19-21, 63-68, 79, 118—120, 177, 222,
279, 369, 405—409 (and with this passage, establishing the
sanction for the Roman ceremony¹ in sacrifice, compare 545,
‘et capita ante aras Phrygio velamur amictu ⁷), 437—440
(with which injunction to appease the offended Juno and
the promise of victory compare the prophecy of Jove in
Aen. i. 279-282 :—

‘Quin aspera Iuno,
................. mecumque fovebit
Romanos, rerum dominos, gentemque togatamlz’
525-529‚ 543-547·
Then we notice the Roman spirit in the prayer to Apollo,
‘ Da propriam, Thymbraee, domum3 da moenia fessis
Et genus et mansuram urbem³' (85),

 

¹ Sellar, Vz'7 gzstl p. 273, writes: In the religious spirit of Virgil,
which accepts and does not question, which finds its resource in
prayer rather than in reverent contemplation and searching out the
ways of God, we may recognize a true note of his nationality—a
submissive attitude in the presence of the Invisible Power, derived
from the race whose custorn it was to veil the head in sacrifice and
in approaching the images of the gods ' ; and he quotes Mommsen,
bk. i. ch. 2 : ⁴ As the Greek when he sacrificed raised his eyes to
heaven, so the Roman veiled his head : sor the prayer os the former
was vision, that of the latter reflectionf

² ιΝτιγ, Juno‘s sels, whose wild alarms
Set ocean, earth, and heaven in arms,
Shall change sor smiles her moody frown,
And vie with me in zeal to crown
Rome's sons, the nation of the gown.'
‘O grant us, Thymbra's graeious lord,

A mansion of our own!
Grant us a sure abiding place,
A habitation and a race 1'
