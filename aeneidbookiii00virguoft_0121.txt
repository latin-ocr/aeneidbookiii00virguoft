Nonis. 7 1

l. 460. venerata: passive use os the past participle of a deponent
verb3 cp. Hor. Sat. ii. 2.124 ⁴ venerata Ceres'; ii. 181 ‘remenso'; iii.
475 ‘dignate '; Sall. Cat. 7 ‘adeptas Instanccs in Livy are numerous,
eg. ‘depopulatus‚ expertus, partitus, transgressus, pactus.' See 1. 125 u.

l. 461. quae liceat: the subjunctive depends on the ‘ notion os
class’ in quae (viz. 'os such a kind that it is lawsul ') ; cp. ‘haec
habui quae dicerem!

l. 462. ingentem : proleptic. ‘Raise Troy to a great height.

l. 464. gravisi, the lengthening os the neuter plural in the accented
syllable (arsis) is quite unexampled, and seems to bc due to the
false analogy os the lengthening os the final a of thc nom. first
declension in Ennius, eg. ⁶ Et densis aquila-1 pennis obnixa volabat‚’
where the final vowel retains its original length. This latter licence
was imitated by Yirg. xii. (³48 ‘sancta ad vos anima, atque istius
inscia eulpae,' where the hiatus increases the difficulty. Elsewhere
virgil lengthens short final syllables only in arsis, where there is
abreak in the sense, e. g. ·’ omnia vincit Amor, et nos cedamus Amori)
The lengthening os -quZ stands on a different footing; cp. l. 91 n.

elephanto : the quadrisyllabic ending is allowable in the case os
a Greek noun ; cp. l. 328 ‘ hymenaeos)

l. 466. ingens, ‘massy silvei· plate‚ aud caldrons os Dodona, a
cuirass os plate-mail, triply leashed with gold.¹

Dodonaeos : a literary epithet to enhance their value. The
caldrons at Dodona (in Albania, about eleven miles to the south-west
of Jannina) were suspended 'on oak-trees near a brazen statue which
held a lash in its hand. When the wind blew strong the statue was
agitated and struck against one os the caldrons which communicatcd
the motion to all the rest. From the din so caused the priests drew
their predictions.

l. 467. hamis: the breast-plate was made of small ⁴ plaques' os
metal‚ attached to one another by wire rings or hooks.

trilicem: the ‘ leashes ’ were loops through which the threads os
the warp were passed: the other ends os these were sastened to a rod,
so that, by lifting the latter, the warp was raised, thus enabling the
shuttle containing the thread of the woof to pass underneath. In
more complex weaving two or three ⁴ leashes ‘ were used. To put
on ⁴ leashes ’ in this manner is termed ‘entering ‘ by our weavers ; cp.
further l. 483 n.‚ G. i. 285.

l. 468. conum: a Virgilian inversion sor ‘a splendid helmet with
a cone.' The ⁶ cone ' was the metallic ridge on the skull-piece os a
helmet to which the plume was attached. The genuine Latin word
sor this was apex.

sopor suus occupat artusss ‘natural to the weary.'
