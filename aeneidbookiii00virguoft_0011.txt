PREFACE

b—§O—

THE editing of this and some other books of the
Aeneid was originally undertaken by an accomplished
scholar, who, however, found himself unable, sor reasons
of an official nature, to complete the task. His notes
were placed in my hands by the (leneral Editor, and as
they were in a more or less smished condition it appeared
that there would be little lest for me but to supply Intro-
duction and Appendices, and to correct the press. On
closer study Ι found that Ι could not entirely accept some
of the views advanoed, however ably supported; and as
it was decided that the edition should appear under my
name, and not, as I had hoped, under our joint names, I
asked and obtained leave to use a free hand. I am tbus
responsible for any errors that appear, while I can-
not claim credit for many selicitous turns and scholarly
elucidations.

Thanks are due to those gentlemen who have courte-
ously given me permission to quote srom verse transla-
tions the passages which appear in Appendix Ι, where

more particular acknowledgments are made.
