APPENDIX 1. 91

‘Real‚ is it real, the sace 1 view,
A harbinger of tidings true?
Say, are you living? or is dead,
Then where is Hector?’ so she said,
And tears in copious torrent shed,
And filled the air with eries:
Thus as her tide of passion flows,
Few broken words l interpose:
‘Aye‚ I am living, living still
Through all extremity of ill:
No dream your sense belies.
But say, alas! what new estate
Receives you fallen from such a mate?
What fortune matches the degree
Of Hector's own Andromache?
Still wear you Pyrrhus’ nuptial yoke?'
She dropped her voice, and softly spoke
With lowly downcast eyes:
‘O happy more than all beside,
The Priameian maid,
Who for her dead foe’s pleasure died
Beneath her city’s shade.

But you—what destiny from heaven,
what stress of wind your bark has driven

Unknowing on our coast?
And lives he yet whom once at Troy—
Ascanius? dwells there in the boy

Grief for his mother lost?
Feels he the hereditary flame

His growing spirit fire
At Hector‘s and Aeneas' name,

His uncle and his sire ?'

Ere Night, drawn by the Hours, has encircled half os the
skies,

Keen Palinurus arises from slumber, explores with his eyes

Every wind, drinks in with his ears each sound of the air;

All of the stars as they silently glide in the firmament there

Numbers; observes Arcturus, the Hyads rainily might,

Both of the Bears, and Orion, in golden panoply dight.
