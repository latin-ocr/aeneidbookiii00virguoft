xiv v1RG1L's AENEID: 111.

Virgil, Tucca, and Varius joined the party at Sinuessa ¹, which
would seem to show that Virgil's residence in Campania had
already commenced. It took seven years to elaborate 1116111
10 their present perfection. Virgil read them aloud2 to
Augustus aster his return from his victory over Antony and
Cleopatra at Actium, 31 B. C. If the story be true that the
episode of Orpheus and Eurydice was introduced into
Gemgl'c iv. in place of praise of Gallus, this must have been
done in 26 B.C., after the disgrace and death of Callus.
During the time occupied on the Gemgics, as is evident
from internal evidence, Virgil was living near Naples''·‚ and
probably thence made tours into Sicily and Greece4‚ in
which he acquired information which he afterwards used
sor his great epic. In the beginning of Georg. iii. he had
promised a poem on the achievements of Augustus. This
design he afterwards combined with his early ambition to
celebrate the origin of the Roman people‚ and expanded into
the Aenel'd. In 26 B.C. Augustus writes from Spain, where he
was engaged in the Cantabrian war, demanding with playful
threats that some portion of the Aenesd should be sent to
him. Virgil replies, acknowledging that the request had
been reiterated‚ but saying that he had as yet nothing worthy
of being sent, that he must have been mad to attempt such
a vast work, and was still devoting study to preparation

¹ Hor. S. i. 5. 40 sqq. :—
‘Plotius et Varius Sinuessae Vergiliusque
Occurrunt, animae quales neque candidiores
Terra tulit neque quis inc sit devinctior alten*

² This took place at Atella, a town in Campania, in the year 29
1: 6., when Augustus returned from the East. Virgilv though slow in
speaking, read his poems very impressivcly (ef. below, p. xvi> and
sweetly; and on this occasion was assisted by Maecenas.
³ Geel-g. iv. 563 :Q
‘Illo Vergilium me ternpore dulcis alebat
Parthenope studiis florentem ignobilis oti.’

⁴ The voyage, alluded to by Hor. C. i. 3, may be assigned to this
time. 'l'hough the ode was not published till 23 1;.C. 11 may have
bet-n lying in Ilorace's Scrinia for years, the arrangement os 1116 first
dozeu odes being manifestly dependent on their metros.
